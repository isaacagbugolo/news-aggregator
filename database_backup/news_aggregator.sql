Asked about rumours on social media that he may have died, he called them “fake news”. The president complained that he had done several news conferences last week “then I didn’t do any for two days and they said ‘there must be something wrong with him’.” “It’s so fake. ‘Is he OK, how’s he feeling, what’s wrong?’” Speculation about his health swirled on X over the weekend, with posts citing his lack of a public schedule late last week and a JD Vance interview in which the vice-president told USA Today he was confident the president was “in good shape” but suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened to Trump. Here’s the day’s Trump administration news at a glance. Trump illegally deployed national guard to LA, court rules A judge has found the Trump administration’s use of national guard troops during southern California immigration enforcement protests was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer ruled on Tuesday that the administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids. The judge did not require the remaining troops withdrawn, however. Read the full story Ice obtains access to Israeli-made spyware US immigration agents will have access to one of the world’s most sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by the Trump administration to move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone, including encrypted applications. Read the full story US House committee releases more than 33,000 pages of Jeffrey Epstein files The US House of Representatives oversight committee released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein from the justice department. The 33,000 pages included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell as well as what appears to be body-cam footage from police searches and police interviews. The release on Tuesday comes as the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its decision not to release additional files in the case. Read the full story Trump announces Space Command HQ will switch to Alabama from Colorado Donald Trump made his first public appearance in a week on Tuesday to announce that the US Space Command (Spacecom) headquarters, which is tasked with leading national security operations in space, would be in the Republican stronghold of Alabama. Flanked by Republican senators and members of Congress at a White House news conference, Trump said Huntsville, Alabama, would be the new location of the space command. The move reverses a Biden administration decision to put the facility at its current temporary headquarters in Democratic-leaning Colorado. Read the full story Amy Coney Barrett defends US abortion ruling in memoir The conservative supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose controversial fast-track confirmation at the end of Trump’s first presidency led directly to the panel’s vote to strike down abortion rights nationally, has expressed in a new memoir her belief that the ruling “respected the choice” of the American people. Barrett was paid a $2m advance for her book, Listening to the Law, according to CNN, which obtained a copy and published brief extracts on Tuesday, a week before its 9 September publication. Read the full story What else happened today: A US appeals court has allowed US federal trade commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to resume her role at the agency, as Donald Trump tries to remove her from office. Jerry Nadler, a Democratic representative from New York, will retire next year after 34 years in Congress. One of the world’s most prominent hedge fund billionaires, Ray Dalio, has warned that rising inequality is turning the US into an autocratic state and condemned business leaders for failing to speak out against Trump’s policies.

The president complained that he had done several news conferences last week \\u201cthen I didn\\u2019t do any for two days and they said \\u2018there must be something wrong with him\\u2019.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so fake. \\u2018Is he OK, how\\u2019s he feeling, what\\u2019s wrong?\\u2019\\u201d Speculation about his health swirled on X over the weekend, with posts citing his lack of a public schedule late last week and a JD Vance interview in which the vice-president told USA Today he was confident the president was \\u201cin good shape\\u201d but suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened to Trump. Here\\u2019s the day\\u2019s Trump administration news at a glance. Trump illegally deployed national guard to LA, court rules A judge has found the Trump administration\\u2019s use of national guard troops during southern California immigration enforcement protests was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer ruled on Tuesday that the administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids. The judge did not require the remaining troops withdrawn, however. Read the full story Ice obtains access to Israeli-made spyware US immigration agents will have access to one of the world\\u2019s most sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by the Trump administration to move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone, including encrypted applications. Read the full story US House committee releases more than 33,000 pages of Jeffrey Epstein files The US House of Representatives oversight committee released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein from the justice department. The 33,000 pages included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell as well as what appears to be body-cam footage from police searches and police interviews. The release on Tuesday comes as the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its decision not to release additional files in the case. Read the full story Trump announces Space Command HQ will switch to Alabama from Colorado Donald Trump made his first public appearance in a week on Tuesday to announce that the US Space Command (Spacecom) headquarters, which is tasked with leading national security operations in space, would be in the Republican stronghold of Alabama. Flanked by Republican senators and members of Congress at a White House news conference, Trump said Huntsville, Alabama, would be the new location of the space command. The move reverses a Biden administration decision to put the facility at its current temporary headquarters in Democratic-leaning Colorado. Read the full story Amy Coney Barrett defends US abortion ruling in memoir The conservative supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett, whose controversial fast-track confirmation at the end of Trump\\u2019s first presidency led directly to the panel\\u2019s vote to strike down abortion rights nationally, has expressed in a new memoir her belief that the ruling \\u201crespected the choice\\u201d of the American people. Barrett was paid a $2m advance for her book, Listening to the Law, according to CNN, which obtained a copy and published brief extracts on Tuesday, a week before its 9 September publication. Read the full story What else happened today: A US appeals court has allowed US federal trade commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to resume her role at the agency, as Donald Trump tries to remove her from office. Jerry Nadler, a Democratic representative from New York, will retire next year after 34 years in Congress. One of the world\\u2019s most prominent hedge fund billionaires, Ray Dalio, has warned that rising inequality is turning the US into an autocratic state and condemned business leaders for failing to speak out against Trump\\u2019s policies. Woody Allen has said he was impressed by the acting abilities of Donald Trump when he directed the now-president in the 1998 film Celebrity. Catching up?

Bad news: now they’re betting on their periods | Arwa Mahdawi', 'Speculating on basketball players’ menstrual cycles is creepy and intrusive. In other words, it’s just what you’d expect when women must be punished for standing out, writes Arwa Mahdawi', 'Forget the bald eagle or the Statue of Liberty – the best symbol of modern America may well be a neon green dildo. Women’s basketball fans will know exactly what I’m talking about. On 29 July, a brightly coloured sex toy was thrown on to the court during the final minutes of play in a WNBA game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. In the weeks that followed, more neon dildos were flung at female basketball players, with at least six WNBA games disrupted. The culprits were reportedly members of a cryptocurrency group trying to boost a memecoin called Green Dildo Coin. It was all very 2025: brainrot stunts, get-rich-quick schemes and memeified misogyny. And, of course, the Trump family joined in. Donald Trump Jr, who fancies himself an edgelord, posted a crude meme of his dad throwing a green dildo on to a court of young, female basketball players. Thanks to a couple of arrests and threats of perpetrators being banned from games, dildo-flinging has now died down. However, women’s basketball is still attracting a lot of toxic attention. The latest indignity professional players are being forced to put up with? Period betting: gamblers are trying to figure out where a player is in her menstrual cycle and are predicting her athletic performance accordingly. It’s hard to know just how widespread the phenomenon is, but Wired recently reported that an increasing number of sports betting influencers are sharing their tips on the strategy. One Instagram user called fademebets, for example, published a video of basketball star Caitlin Clark earlier this year where he announced: “She is on the end of her late luteal phase, meaning a decrease in cardio, decrease in strength, decrease in aerobic system. She’s going to be tired more often than in a normal game.” How on earth would some random internet user know where a professional athlete is in her cycle? Most of the time it seems they are just guessing. On the podcast Stuff Island, comedian James McCann said he had met a gambler who used injury reports, including references to “soreness”, to estimate menstrual cycles. Give it some time, however, and perhaps they’ll start hacking commercial period tracking apps, many of which already leak sensitive user data. Earlier this year, for example, a federal jury found that Meta violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by collecting data from Flo, a popular period tracking app, without user consent. While period cycle betting is invasive and creepy, these gamblers aren’t entirely off-base in their reasoning: your menstrual cycle can have an impact on your athletic performance. Indeed, researchers at University College London just published a study that found female athletes have faster reaction times during ovulation. Perhaps, if we’re looking for silver linings, there is some positive benefit to men getting interested in luteal phases and women’s hormone levels. Perhaps if we get enough gamblers deciding there is money to be made from this, we’ll see more resources go towards women’s health, which is chronically underfunded? Humour me here: I’m trying to be positive. It’s difficult, but I’m trying. If we are really trying to look on the bright side, the rise of period betting points to just how popular women’s sports are becoming. Women’s football, for example, already one of the top 10 most followed sports globally, is on track to become one of the top five sports by 2030, according to Nielsen Sports. And, halfway through the 2025 season, WNBA ratings are breaking records and drawing in a broader fanbase. The New York Times reports that the number of boys under 18 who watch WNBA has grown by 130% over the past four years. Whenever women are in the spotlight, though, there are people who punish them for it. The joy and excitement of the Women’s World Cup in 2023, for example, was overshadowed by Luis Rubiales, the former president of the Spanish Football Federation, kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso on the lips without her consent. It “stained one of the happiest days of my life”, Hermoso said at the time. And there was a record number of reports of abuse at matches in English football during the 2024-25 season, according to data from Kick It Out; complaints of misogyny and sexism drove this increase. Whether it’s sexist chants, dildo tossing or period cycle betting, the world is full of small men desperate to spoil a woman’s big moment. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Some bring good news: you have overpaid and are owed a refund, but others claim you owe money. In both cases there’s an imminent deadline to act – sometimes with the threat of legal action, or penalties if you don’t. Scammers are taking advantage of people’s fears over bills to steal personal and banking information. Automated phone calls, and messages sent by text and email, typically tell you that you need to click on a link and log in to make a payment or claim a refund. In the year to 31 July, HMRC received more than 170,000 reports of scams, of which more than 47,000 involved fake refunds. These happen year-round, but often catch people out around the time of deadlines for self-assessment tax returns. HMRC says it will never contact you in that way to ask you to claim a refund, or give personal details, and that it never leaves voicemail messages threatening legal action or arrest. What the scam looks like Messages can be very convincing and bear the logo and details of HMRC. They will tell you to act quickly so you feel panicked into responding. There will be a link, and the website it takes you to may also be very convincing. However, check the URL and it won’t be an official gov.uk address. Caller ID can be spoofed so it appears that it is genuinely HMRC getting in touch. What to do If you think you may genuinely be owed a refund, or are concerned that you have underpaid, you can find out via your tax account.

(104, NULL, NULL, 'media/2025/nov/08/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary', 'BBC ‘100% fake news’, says Donald Trump’s press secretary', 'Comments by Karoline Leavitt follow allegations that Panorama documentary misled viewers with its editing of a Trump speech', 'Donald Trump’s press secretary has described the BBC as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine” in an outspoken interview that comes after allegations of bias at the broadcaster. Karoline Leavitt, a senior White House official in the Trump administration, said watching BBC bulletins while on trips to the UK “ruins” her day, saying taxpayers were being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine”. Leavitt’s comments came after MPs said the corporation had “serious questions to answer” about the way a speech by the US president was edited by a BBC Panorama documentary. A document leaked to the Telegraph suggested that an episode of the current affairs programme “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of the speech together. The programme showed Trump saying he would walk with his supporters to the Capitol before the riots on 6 January 2021, urging them to “fight like hell”. However, it omitted a section of the speech where Trump urged the crowd “to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard”. It was reported late on Saturday that the BBC was expected to apologise for the way the speech was edited, with a BBC spokesperson saying the organisation’s chair would provide a “full response to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Monday”. In an interview with the Telegraph, Leavitt said: “This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom. “Every time I travel to the United Kingdom with President Trump and am forced to watch the BBC in our hotel rooms, it ruins my day listening to their blatant propaganda and lies about the president of the United States and all that he’s doing to make America better and the world a safer place.” The newspaper said its reporting was based on a memo written by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee. Prescott left his role earlier this year and has not commented on the document, understood to have been leaked by a whistleblower. It published an extract that read: “It was completely misleading to edit the clip in the way Panorama aired it. The fact that he did not explicitly exhort supporters to go down and fight at Capitol Hill was one of the reasons there were no federal charges for incitement to riot.” The memo reportedly added that Prescott, a communications consultant and former political journalist, had raised concerns about the way BBC Arabic covered the war in Gaza. The Telegraph said Prescott alleged there were “systemic problems”, which had not been addressed by senior management, claiming there were “stark differences” between the coverage of the war on BBC Arabic and on the main BBC website. One issue Prescott is said to have highlighted is the repeated use of commentators who were antisemitic or pro-Hamas. The 19-page dossier is also reported to have criticised the BBC’s coverage of transgender issues, saying the broadcaster had been “captured by a small group of [staff] promoting the Stonewall view” of gender identity issues and that its LGBT desk would “decline to cover any stories raising difficult questions”. It is said to have alleged that stories raising complex questions about trans issues were suppressed, with a “constant drip-feed of one-sided stories celebrating the trans experience without adequate balance or objectivity”. In response, the BBC said: “While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully. “Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/08/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0ca6dcb956f1c815a1ad329c4b31d3802da1bfeb/567_0_2825_2261/500.jpg', '2025-11-08 20:19:26', '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/nov\\/08\\/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-08T12:19:26Z\",\"webTitle\":\"BBC \\u2018100% fake news\\u2019, says Donald Trump\\u2019s press secretary\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/nov\\/08\\/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/nov\\/08\\/bbc-100-fake-news-says-donald-trumps-press-secretary\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"BBC \\u2018100% fake news\\u2019, says Donald Trump\\u2019s press secretary\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Comments by Karoline Leavitt follow allegations that Panorama documentary misled viewers with its editing of a Trump speech<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Comments by Karoline Leavitt follow allegations that Panorama documentary misled viewers with its editing of a Trump speech\",\"byline\":\"Geraldine McKelvie\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"0ca6dcb956f1c815a1ad329c4b31d3802da1bfeb\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/0ca6dcb956f1c815a1ad329c4b31d3802da1bfeb\\/567_0_2825_2261\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Karoline Leavitt talks at a lectern next to the US flag\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Karoline Leavitt: \\u2018Every time I travel to the United Kingdom with President Trump and am forced to watch the BBC in our hotel rooms, it ruins my day.\\u2019<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Mehmet Eser\\/Zuma Press Wire\\/Shutterstock<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>Donald Trump\\u2019s press secretary has described the BBC as \\u201c100% fake news\\u201d and a \\u201cpropaganda machine\\u201d in an outspoken interview that comes after allegations of bias at the broadcaster.<\\/p> <p>Karoline Leavitt, a senior White House official in the Trump administration, said watching BBC bulletins while on trips to the UK \\u201cruins\\u201d her day, saying taxpayers were being \\u201cforced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine\\u201d.<\\/p> <p>Leavitt\\u2019s comments came after MPs said the corporation had \\u201cserious questions to answer\\u201d about the way a speech by the US president was edited by a BBC Panorama documentary.<\\/p> <p>A document leaked to the Telegraph suggested that an episode of the current affairs programme \\u201ccompletely misled\\u201d viewers by splicing two parts of the speech together.<\\/p> <p>The programme showed Trump saying he would walk with his supporters to the Capitol before the riots on 6 January 2021, urging them to \\u201cfight like hell\\u201d.

FIEG, the Italian federation of newspaper publishers, said it has submitted a formal complaint to Agcom, Italy’s communications watchdog. Similar complaints have been filed in other EU countries. Coordinated by the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association, the aim is to push the European Commission to open an investigation against Google under the EU Digital Services Act. The threat posed by AI Overviews, which gives users information without them having to click through to the original source by summarising searches with a block of text at the top of the results page, is among the main concerns of European news outlets. FIEG said it was also worried about the more recent AI Mode, which takes information from multiple sources and presents them as a chatbot. The federation argues that the Google services “violate fundamental provisions of the digital services act, with detrimental effects on Italian users, consumers and businesses”. “Google is becoming a traffic killer,” FIEG said in a statement, adding that the products not only directly compete with content produced by publishing firms, but also “reduces their visibility and discoverability, and thus their advertising revenues”. “This has serious consequences for the economic sustainability and diversity of the media, with all the risks associated with a lack of transparency and the proliferation of disinformation in democratic debate,” the statement said. A study published in July by the UK-based Authoritas analytics company claimed AI Overviews, launched by Google last year, caused up to 80% fewer clickthroughs. The research, which was submitted as part of a legal complaint to the UK’s competition watchdog about the impact of Google AI Overviews, also found that links to YouTube – owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet – were more prominent compared with the normal search result system. A second study by the Pew Research Center, a US thinktank, also showed a big hit to referral traffic from Google AI Overviews, with users only clicking a link under an AI summary once every 100 times. Google claimed the studies were inaccurate and based on flawed methodology. Google AI Overviews arrived in Italy in March. In September, the country became the first in the EU to approve a comprehensive law regulating the use of artificial intelligence, including limiting child access and imposing prison terms on those who use the technology to cause harm, such as generating deepfakes. Giorgia Meloni’s government described the legislation, which aligns with the EU’s landmark AI Act, as a decisive move in influencing how AI is used across Italy.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/16/google-ai-overviews-italian-news-publishers-demand-investigation', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/4facf3c2d97e936db3c14109c41fa75377ace05e/339_0_2433_1946/500.jpg', '2025-10-16 19:53:59', '{\"id\":\"technology\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/google-ai-overviews-italian-news-publishers-demand-investigation\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"technology\",\"sectionName\":\"Technology\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-16T12:53:59Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Italian news publishers demand investigation into Google\\u2019s AI Overviews\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/technology\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/google-ai-overviews-italian-news-publishers-demand-investigation\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/technology\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/google-ai-overviews-italian-news-publishers-demand-investigation\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Italian news publishers demand investigation into Google\\u2019s AI Overviews\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Newspaper federation says \\u2018traffic killer\\u2019 feature violates legislation and threatens to destroy media diversity<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Newspaper federation says \\u2018traffic killer\\u2019 feature violates legislation and threatens to destroy media diversity\",\"byline\":\"Angela Giuffrida Rome correspondent\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"05ff4a8c9e0f030026ecb64ef861d1245bf88a99\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/05ff4a8c9e0f030026ecb64ef861d1245bf88a99\\/212_0_3004_2403\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"A general view of the Google homepage on a phone\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">The AI-generated summaries created in Google searches have \\u2018detrimental effects on Italian users, consumers and businesses\\u2019, according to FIEG.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews\\/PA<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>Italian news publishers are calling for an investigation into Google\\u2019s AI Overviews, arguing that the search engine\\u2019s AI-generated summaries feature is a \\u201ctraffic killer\\u201d that threatens their survival.<\\/p> <p>FIEG, the Italian federation of newspaper publishers, said it has submitted a formal complaint to Agcom, Italy\\u2019s communications watchdog.<\\/p> <p>Similar complaints have been filed in other EU countries.

As chief executive of broadcasting for News Corp, McKenna’s role had significantly diminished after the pay TV and streaming business, which includes Kayo, Binge and Hubbl, was sold to the European broadcaster in April. A former partner at McKinsey &amp; Company, McKenna was Murdoch’s key adviser in the epic family trust case, which saw him take control of his father’s global media empire and secure the future of the Australian stable of newspapers, magazines and news channels. The 53-year-old businessperson was heavily involved in the negotiations with Rupert Murdoch’s three “objecting children” in the Nevada court case, which was settled in the US last month. The three oldest siblings received an estimated US$1.1bn each for their shares in the business. Sign up: AU Breaking News email McKenna will leave the company at the end of the year, staff were told by News Corp’s global chief executive, Robert Thomson, in an email on Thursday morning. “Her decision, and it is her decision, is essentially epochal as Siobhan has been a transformational force during her years with News Corp,” Thomson said. “The word ‘visionary’ is often abused, but not in Siobhan’s case, as her ability to perceive the future from the haze-shrouded shapes on the horizon is nonpareil. She is irreplaceable.” McKenna and Lachlan set up the private investment company Illyria 20 years ago, having both great success with Nova Entertainment and significant losses when he took over the Ten network in 2012 before it went into voluntary administration in 2017. The Albanese government appointed McKenna as chair of Australia Post in 2022, citing her commercial, strategic, digital and technology experience. Thomson said McKenna navigated Sky News Australia and Foxtel through a “treacherous tech landscape” and made them into “global success stories”. “The worth of Foxtel was instinctively appreciated by the global leader in sports streaming, DAZN, which recently acquired the company, and with whom we have an ongoing partnership,” he said. “Sky was transformed from a traditional broadcaster to a digital powerhouse whose efficacious impact stretches far beyond the borders of Australia. The success of both companies marks a profound turning point for our company and a professional inflexion point for Siobhan.” Lachlan is the chair of News Corp, the parent company of more than two dozen publications including the Wall Street Journal, The Times and the New York Post, after he succeeded his father in 2023 and executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/30/lachlan-murdoch-top-adviser-siobhan-mckenna-resigns-from-news-corp', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/43497f8f487bb3db9791c2b65280faec40d8c394/732_0_3473_2780/500.jpg', '2025-10-30 07:45:53', '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/oct\\/30\\/lachlan-murdoch-top-adviser-siobhan-mckenna-resigns-from-news-corp\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-30T00:45:53Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Lachlan Murdoch\\u2019s top adviser Siobhan McKenna resigns from News Corp\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/30\\/lachlan-murdoch-top-adviser-siobhan-mckenna-resigns-from-news-corp\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/30\\/lachlan-murdoch-top-adviser-siobhan-mckenna-resigns-from-news-corp\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Lachlan Murdoch\\u2019s top adviser Siobhan McKenna resigns from News Corp\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Company\\u2019s Australian broadcast chief, who was involved in negotiations over Murdoch family\\u2019s succession plans, to depart media giant<\\/p><ul><li><p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/australia-news\\/live\\/2025\\/oct\\/30\\/anthony-albanese-donald-trump-meeting-murray-watt-epbc-nature-laws-press-club-parliament-labor-coalition-sussan-ley-ntwnfb\\\">Follow our Australia news live blog for latest updates<\\/a><\\/p><\\/li><li><p>Get our <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\\\">breaking news email<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/app.adjust.com\\/w4u7jx3\\\">free app<\\/a> or <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/australia-news\\/series\\/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\\\">daily news podcast<\\/a><\\/p><\\/li><\\/ul>\",\"trailText\":\"Company\\u2019s Australian broadcast chief, who was involved in negotiations over Murdoch family\\u2019s succession plans, to depart media giant\",\"byline\":\"Amanda Meade\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"43497f8f487bb3db9791c2b65280faec40d8c394\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/43497f8f487bb3db9791c2b65280faec40d8c394\\/0_0_5005_3478\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Foxtel\\u2019s Siobhan McKenna speaking at an AFL event in 2022.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"695\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Siobhan McKenna speaking at an AFL event in 2022.

Will jobs be protected? And when will production restart?', 'Jaguar Land Rover’s factories have been shut for almost a month after a cyber-attack that forced it to turn off computer systems in the UK, Slovakia, India and Brazil. The UK government has stepped in with support for JLR, and the company has started to prepare for a very limited restart of production. However, the company’s workers and supply chains are still facing weeks of uncertainty. Here’s the latest on what we know. What is happening now at Jaguar Land Rover? The extent of the hack means the company is having to rebuild in stages. The first things back up and running were IT systems that make it possible to pay suppliers, send cars to retailers and spare parts to mechanics – the latter being crucial to avoid alienating loyal customers. However, the stages of restart will mean that a return to full production is still likely to be weeks or even months away. Suppliers are talking of six or seven weeks with no revenues, with broader disruption almost certain to last months. How much will it cost? David Bailey, professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, has estimated that a month of downtime would mean £1.7bn in lost revenues, or about £120m in profits. Nevertheless, investors appear sanguine about JLR’s ability to ride it out. JLR is not a listed company, but so far the Indian-listed share price of its parent, Tata Motors, has barely been disturbed during the month of crisis at one of its key subsidiaries. Neither has the market-implied risk of default on JLR’s bonds risen markedly. Analysts at Creditsights, a debt rating agency, said that JLR’s cash burn could reach as high as £2.6bn over a 30-day period, mainly because of outgoings rising while revenues slump. However, that is not necessarily the same as a loss if JLR can make back some of its sales later. What help has the government announced? Even if the risk for JLR is not existential, £2.6bn would still be a large amount of cash to burn in the short term. For that reason, it has welcomed the government stepping in over the weekend with a guarantee on loans worth £1.5bn. The guarantee will be offered by the export credit agency UK Export Finance and the loan will be paid back over five years, the government said. JLR also agreed a separate £2bn debt deal with America’s Citigroup, Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ and Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, bringing its total new funding to £3.5bn. JLR declined to comment on the debt agreement, which was first reported by the Economic Times. Will this help the supply chain? The business secretary, Peter Kyle, said on Saturday that the loan guarantee would “help support the supply chain and protect skilled jobs in the West Midlands, Merseyside and throughout the UK”. However, there are still questions over whether that money will help the network of suppliers who rely on JLR as their main source of business. JLR is expected to use the cash from the loan to continue to pay invoices that were outstanding at the time of the hack. However, it is not thought likely that the manufacturer will advance credit to suppliers – and it has no relationship with companies further down its supply chain. Supply chains are often split into separate “tiers”. Tier 1 suppliers send their products directly to JLR, but their products (such as seats or gearboxes) are often made up of smaller parts that come from tier 2, and so on. JLR does not have a direct relationship with many of the companies – often small and family-owned – in the lower tiers. The government should ensure that money does filter further through to the smaller companies, said Stephen Morley, president of the Confederation of British Metalforming, a lobby group that counts many JLR suppliers among its members. “This needs to go down the supply chain as well. We need some clarification from JLR on what’s going to happen now. We need some direction for the tier 1s to pass it down. A tier 2 supplier can still stop JLR,” said Morley. What about workers? JLR told staff on Monday that it would aim to restart some production “in the coming days”, and its Wolverhampton engine factory is expected to be among the first to get back online. However, the bulk of JLR factory workers remain at home, with only tentative signs of when they might be able to return. Government support has come too late for many workers in the supply chain. Smaller companies immediately moved to lay off temporary workers in order to save costs, while permanent workers’ jobs are also under threat in companies whose income is mostly or even solely derived from JLR business. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union that represents many JLR workers, said: “The money provided must now be used to ensure job guarantees and to also protect skills and pay in JLR and its supply chain.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/29/jaguar-land-rover-cyber-attack-whats-the-latest-news', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cb4884e8ca77d34cf19c4699572778fecea92679/288_0_3275_2620/500.jpg', '2025-09-29 21:24:34', '{\"id\":\"business\\/2025\\/sep\\/29\\/jaguar-land-rover-cyber-attack-whats-the-latest-news\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"business\",\"sectionName\":\"Business\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-09-29T14:24:34Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack: what\\u2019s the latest news?\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/business\\/2025\\/sep\\/29\\/jaguar-land-rover-cyber-attack-whats-the-latest-news\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/business\\/2025\\/sep\\/29\\/jaguar-land-rover-cyber-attack-whats-the-latest-news\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack: what\\u2019s the latest news?\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>How is the government helping the carmaker?

Key US politics stories from Wednesday 23 July', 'Donald Trump is facing a widening crisis amid a report claiming that his name appears in US justice department files about Jeffrey Epstein as Congress subpoenas testimony from Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The White House sought to downplay the relationship between the US president and the disgraced financier while Trump’s spokesperson denied an account in the Wall Street Journal that the president was told in May by attorney general Pam Bondi that he is named in the Epstein files. The report says the president was told that many other high profile figures were also named and states that being mentioned in the records isn’t a sign of wrongdoing. “The fact is that the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep,” spokesperson Steven Cheung said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.” A federal judge, meanwhile, denied a justice department request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. Here’s more on these and the day’s other key Trump administration stories: Trump’s name reported to feature in Epstein files Attorney general Pam Bondi has pushed back against a report claiming that Donald Trump’s name appears “multiple times” in US justice department files about Jeffrey Epstein, saying that “nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution”. “As part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings,” Bondi and her deputy said in a statement. White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement: “The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.” Read the full story Judge rejects Trump bid to unseal Epstein jury transcripts A US federal judge has denied a justice department request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to a criminal investigation of Epstein, the late sex offender and financier, in south Florida from the mid-2000s. The move on Wednesday is the first ruling in the Trump administration’s series of attempts to release more information after the justice department announced it would not be releasing any additional files related to the Epstein case, despite earlier promises from Trump and Bondi.

On Wednesday, the court questioned one avenue of the president’s authority: his ability to impose sweeping global tariffs. Justices heard oral arguments on the legality of the tariffs, with conservative justices expressing skepticism of the strength of the Trump administration’s position. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said Chief Justice John Roberts. The arguments center on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a 1977 law which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency. Trump cited the law as he slapped steep duties on imports into the US. About 40 legal briefs have been filed in opposition to the tariffs, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the US. US supreme court justices express skepticism over legality of Trump tariffs The Trump administration faced tough questions at the US supreme court over the legality of its sweeping global tariff regime, as justices expressed skepticism over the law it used to slap steep duties on almost every US trading partner. Should the supreme court ultimately rule against Trump’s tariffs it will force the White House to go back to the drawing board and reconsider how to enforce an aggressive economic policy which has strained global trade ties.

Other posts included videos of Trump appearing to read nearly verbatim from his own previously posted Truth Social text posts.

Read the full story Democrats celebrate while Republicans stew over Mamdani’s win Left-leaning Americans awoke to a rare recent moment of political celebration with Democratic victories in several elections across the country, led by the election of Zohran Mamdani as the next mayor of New York, while Republicans breathlessly hailed the end of the country. Many Republicans’ immediate reaction was to attribute Mamdani’s win to an electorate overrepresented by immigrants, snidely implying they were not “real” Americans.

It asks the court to block the new maps from taking effect, at least temporarily.

(115, NULL, NULL, 'football/live/2025/oct/31/weekend-team-news-and-previews-football-live', 'Premier League’s festive fixture lineup confirmed: football news – as it happened', 'Our writers provide the latest news and team news heading into the weekend’s football action', 'And with that, it’s goodbye from the Friday blog. Fulham v Wolves is that six-pointer, with the pressure far more on the Wolves manager than Marco Silva. Wolves won this one last season, courtesy of Matheus Cunha. It still didn’t save Gary O’Neil. Sunday will see Manchester City v Bournemouth, and there’s a mutual appreciation society developing between Pep Guardiola and Andoni Iraola. The latter seems to be mastering the art of staying humble. Iraola said: “I want City to win every game, I want Liverpool to win every game, I want Arsenal to win every game - those are not our rivals. When they face other teams, I don’t want them to lose any points. It’s not because for one week we could be a little bit ahead. At the end of the season, we know we are not going to be there with those teams. We will be in another fight. “They have Haaland, who is probably better than ever, scoring a lot of goals. It’s not about only Haaland. The problem is, you focus too much on Haaland, and they have tons of players - I think (Omar) Marmoush, every time he plays against us scores, for example.” Here’s your weekend ahead on the website. As ever, it’s ram-packed. Oliver Glasner is often a calm customer, but Crystal Palace’s fixture pile-up has revealed an angrier side. His team face a Carabao Cup quarter-final on Tuesday 16 or Wednesday 17 December but, with Palace hosting the Finnish side KuPS at on 18 December in the Conference League, the tie at the Emirates Stadium being played on Tuesday leaves Palace playing twice in 54 hours. Arsenal are unlikely to agree to playing the cup game on 23 December. Glasner isn’t happy: ““Honestly, I can’t believe that it will be fixed in that way. I think it would be irresponsible for the players. And everybody has a responsibility for the players. And we have to look after their welfare. That’s our main responsibility - and not just at the club. “When I heard it for the first time yesterday [Thursday], I couldn’t believe it that they are considering this. I’m really upset - because I spoke about this issue three months ago when I looked at the schedule. In the summer, in the off-season, there are people who have to work on the schedule. “I would really prefer if they talk together. It would be nice if Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and the EFL talked together because it’s not so surprising that this can happen. And now they’re finding something where you can’t find a solution? Get it organised and sorted before. This makes me really upset.” Some more Nuno on West Ham. This won’t enthuse Hammers fans, as he discusses team selections that have confounded them. “It’s something that doesn’t please us, something that personally I don’t like. I would like to have found a solution earlier and stick to it, but I think it’s our obligation to try and find the solutions because the team is not producing. We started with Andy [Irving] and Tomas [Soucek] against Leeds and it didn’t quite work. The second half was better, so we are still looking. I hope that we can solve all the problems faster than we are solving them. It’s going to take a very long time, but honestly I wish that we can stick with one and the team clicks and it goes well so we can move forward.” Here’s Jamie Jackson on that festive fixture news. Sad news reaches us of the death of Colin Addison, a name you might recall from probably the greatest FA Cup shock of all, non-league Hereford United beating Newcastle 2-1 in 1972, as the club’s player-manager. Addison also coached Celta Vigo and Atletico Madrid, as a exceedingly well-travelled coach. He also played for York, Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and Sheffield United. He was 85. He spoke to Jamie Jackson in 2007 for the below piece. Every day I walk through the town someone mentions it. I’m from Somerset, but I’m adopted here. They named a street after me, Addison Court. That was nice. Five years ago I went back to St James’ Park for the first time. I saw Malcolm Macdonald. The fag fell out his mouth and he said: ‘Fucking hell, not you again!’ Alex Whitney gets in touch: “There has been, understandably, a lot of talk about the (arguably) bigger teams struggling against low blocks this season. Arsenal relying on too many set piece goals as a result, etc etc. But tell me - which teams have recently been playing well against low blocks? Aside from De Bruyne-era City, can someone enlighten me as to who Chelsea in this example should model themselves after?” Here’s our collation of the weekend tean news. The Premier League has announced the festive season fixture schedule. There will be just one match on Boxing Day, Manchester United taking on Newcastle, a Friday night fixture at 8pm, with a full weekend to follow. Further match days follow on 30 December, where six matches will be played in the evening, and then four on 1 January. After that, games over the weekend of 3 and 4 January, and then a midweek round played over Tuesday 6 January, Wednesday 7 January. To close out, on 8 January, Arsenal v Liverpool. And then it’s the FA Cup… All the details here Here’s today’s Football Daily, on the touchy subject of AI, penned by, well, me actually. Jacob Steinberg previews Saturday’s west London derby. This is a hard game to read. Spurs are five points off first place and unbeaten in the Champions League. Chelsea are world champions and reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup this week. However, fans of both sides remain unconvinced by Frank and Maresca. Spurs supporters have grumbled about a lack of creativity when the onus is on their team to attack; Chelsea’s moan about their young side’s immaturity, indiscipline and toils against low blocks. Fulham v Wolves on Saturday has the look of a relegation six-pointer, with Marco Silva’s team losing the last four matches. They have suffered for their lack of signings last summer. Silva isn’t quite using Brendan Rodgers’ “Honda Civic” metaphor but the message to owner Shad Khan is fairly explicit. “Something we didn’t do in August, we should have done. It’s not the moment to talk about it. With all our players, we will be strong and competitive. But results speak louder. We have to be prepared for January.” Cristian Romero will be back for Tottenham when they face Chelsea tomorrow evening. Thomas Frank: “The positive news is that Romero, Destiny (Udogie) and Wilson (Odobert) are available for selection for Saturday. I am very aware of trying to be able to take the best possible decisions. Of course in the end I will get a lot of information from medical staff, performance staff, but in the end it is always on me. “If a player breaks down, it is on me. It is not on the medical staff, not on the performance staff, always me. I take decisions, I get all the information and then I have to take a difficult choice or a braver choice, or an easy choice, so that is it. If Romero was fit enough, he would have been involved on Wednesday (against Newcastle), but he is ready to be involved and let’s see how he is.” Pep has also been talking about his assistants. “I think not me, Man City, Pep Lijnders and Kolo [Toure] and James [French] on set-pieces, it is a joy to work with them. It is a joy to work with them and I am so happy. I was in the past but we are talking this season. “I am learning a lot. The most important thing for me is people that can add something to my knowledge as a manager and I have it. We talk a lot and that is so nice because it is why you are a manager. Football is not just the pleasure of playing, it is to talk as well and how we can help the team. I feel embrace for all of them and that is all I can ask.” Pep Guardiola has compared the Premier League’s competitiveness to the NBA (America’s National Basketball Association) due to there being “no dominant team in the last four or six years”. While Manchester City’s manager added that “everyone can beat anyone”, there has been a dominant side: his, as apart from last term when Liverpool were champions, City claimed the title for in a record four consecutive years - 2020-21 to ‘23-24. Guardiola’s point may be that in those seasons Liverpool and Arsenal were always serious challengers to City. He said: “The Premier League has always been like this, all the teams can beat each other, it is good. At some point like the NBA, there is not a dominant team in the last four or five or six years. There is always one different team and everyone can beat everyone. I think for the spectator and for the show of the Premier League it is really, really good. “I remember when I was in [Bayern] Munich or Barcelona, I always heard the rumours that in England, everyone could beat everyone. I always had that sense. Maybe Liverpool and ourselves in the past changed that dynamic because we were so consistent in terms of points and arriving every season with 90, 90, 90 points, close to 100 points.” While the NBA has been claimed by six different franchises since 2020 - the LA Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma Thunder – Guardiola believes City are close to being near their very best again. “Still, we are not at our best, but we are close. I think I had the feeling, I said a month ago that these words would be completely devastating if you don’t get results. I know that, but I had the feeling when I see the team, when I see in the dressing room, in the trainings, and how we apply, how we want to try to do things, I had the feeling,” said the manager. “[And] that when I think Rodri can come [to] his best, that he will not be soon at his best, but he can help us, and alongside all the alternatives I can have, we will be a team that will be difficult for the opponents to beat us, and this is what I want. Will we be still close to the fight [for the title then]? I don’t know.” City are in fifth place, six points behind Arsenal, and host second-place Bournemouth in Sunday’s late game. Guardiola said that Rodri may be available to play some part following a hamstring problem. “I think he will be ready to help us. I dunno from the beginning but hopefully with us,” said the manager. Handover: John Brewin is here to see you down the home straight. Be gentle with him. Leeds United: Ao Tanaka has been told not to be too self-critical by his manager Daniel Farke after the Japan midfielder claimed he was currently “not good enough” for the Premier League. Tanaka gave a harsh appraisal of his own performance in last week’s home win against West Ham in a radio interview, having returned to the starting line-up following a spell out through injury. The 27-year-old sustained an MCL injury in the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal in August and then had to be patient due to the form of Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach in his absence. “I like it if someone is humble and self-critical and puts the crossbar for his demands really high,” said Farke. “I quite like that because normally in this business it’s the other way round. But he doesn’t have to say this, not at all. There’s no reason to be so self-critical because Ao was fantastic for us in the Championship and it’s his first time in a top division and he has a point to prove there.” Farke said Tanaka was in his starting line-up for the opening-day win against Everton after “a fantastic pre-season” and cannot be blamed for his injury. PA Media Burnley v Arsenal: Scott Parker believes Burnley can take confidence from their previous clashes with the Premier League’s elite sides ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with table-topping Arsenal. Burnley have already faced Tottenham, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City since their return to the top flight this summer and have lost all four games. They did, however, run both Liverpool and Manchester United very close. “Every single game we’ve been involved in this [season], there have been parts of games where I look at us and I think, ‘We’re hugely competitive here, we’re right in this game’,” said Parker. “It’s a squad constantly learning, I do see a progression. At the weekend [a 3-2 win at Wolves] I thought it was the best we’ve played with the ball. It’s those experiences that we’ve been through that are improving us and hopefully we keep nudging on.” Burnley have beaten Sunderland, Leeds and Wolves this season and Parker has called on home fans to play their part at Turf Moor this weekend. “While we’re up against a very good team, we need to have a real understanding of what this team don’t want to face,” he said. “We’re going to need to bring absolutely humongous energy into this stadium, our players are going to need to bring unbelievable spirit, and, with that, we’ll try and make it as uncomfortable [as we can] and try and get a result.” Fulham v Wolves: Although you wouldn’t know it going by their results, Vitor Pereira is convinced he has the solution to his side’s woes and knows exactly what they need to do to drag themselves away from the foot of the table. “I know a way to change the current situation and the answer is to work hard every day,” he says. “I’m trying to convince my team that we have quality and convince them to keep their energy up. We have to go into the next game against Fulham with ambition. We have to increase our tactical organisation. We need to keep fighting because I think we deserve a result from the way that we work.” To be fair, I’m inclined to agree with Vitor. While Wolves are no great shakes, I don’t think they’re among the three worst sides in the top flight, despite their lowly status. I also think they’re due a win and will see off Fulham tomorrow afternoon but other opinions are available. Fulham v Wolves: Bottom of the table and still looking for their first win of the season, Wolves got knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Chelsea in midweek, despite a spirited comeback after going 3-0 down. Last weekend, Wolves lost another nail-biter against Burnley, losing 3-2 in added time after overturning a two-goal deficit. Following that particular game, both Jorgen Strand Larsen and the team’s head coach Vitor Pereira had to be ushered away from unhappy fans after Getting Into It with them in an impromptu post-match debrief. “Jorgen went over to thank the supporters,” said Pereira this afternoon, when asked about the incident. “I felt my players gave everything to win the game, but right at the end they committed a mistake to lose the game. “I went over to explain that we are fighting and fighting, but we must fight together. I understand the frustration [from the fans] because I’m also frustrated. The Carabao Cup result wasn’t the result we wanted either, but I felt a connection between the supporters and the team again, which is important to me.” West Ham v Newcastle United: Yet to win under Nuno Espirito Santo, their second manager of the season, West Ham host Newcastle on Sunday afternoon and their Portuguese head coach, who already has about him the air of a man who knows he’s made a terrible error of judgement in taking over from Graham Potter, has been issuing some team news. Central defender Konstantinos Mavropanos will be out for “another couple of weeks” with a thigh injury, while Oliver Scarles will be sidelined until December after undergoing surgery on a shoulder injury. German striker Niclas Fullkrug also remains absent with a thigh injury. Sunderland v Everton: Having come up through the playoffs, Sunderland are riding high in fourth place and host Everton on Monday night at the Stadium of Light in a match many people will be expecting them to win. In Enzo Le Fez, Noah Sadiki, Nordi Mukiele, Habib Diarra and Chemsine Talbi, to name but a few of their 14 summer signings, the eartly signs suggest that Sunderland did some excellent business in the transfer window over the summer but arguably the pick of the bunch of new recruits, given the experience he brings to this young squad, has been Granit Xhaka. The Swiss veteran’s arrival at the Stadium of Light from Bayer Leverkusen raised more than a few eyebrows and Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris has been talking up the club captain. “To be competitive at that level, you need to own the performance on the pitch,” he said. “Granit helps a lot because he can manage different elements on the pitch. He’s not alone but he gives hope and faith that we can win. He shows it, tells it in the dressing room. The target as a coach is this, you don’t want to be the main man, this is not my purpose. I want to give knowledge, power, responsibility to the squad because you have to manage the game in real time. We have other players on the pitch able to manage micro situations, not just Granit. We are able to improve our level, to be more flexible and more adaptable.” Reading: Sacked from his position as head coach last weekend after a 1-1 draw with Doncaster left Reading 19th in League One, Noel Hunt has released a statement through the League Managers’ Association. “I am disappointed to have left the club so early into the League One season, especially with so much still to play for,” it says. “When I took over as manager of Reading almost a year ago, the club was facing an incredibly difficult and uncertain period. The ownership situation was unstable, we were operating under a transfer embargo, and we had lost several key members of the squad. At that time, the very survival of the club was in jeopardy. “Despite those challenges, I am immensely proud of the progress we made together – stabilising the club, rebuilding belief, and creating a strong and united team that came within touching distance of the play-offs on the final day of the season. “Over the summer, we had hoped to build on those foundations. Unfortunately, circumstances meant we once again faced the huge task of rebuilding, with 15 players and key members of my backroom staff leaving before pre-season began. “Even so, I was confident in the group we were developing. The squad was growing stronger each week, and with 32 league games still to play, I truly believed we were on the path to a successful season. While I am naturally disappointed by the club’s decision, I would like to thank everyone connected with Reading Football Club – the staff, my coaching team, and especially the players – for their loyalty, hard work, and professionalism throughout my time there.” Hunt has been replaced by Leam Richardson, 45, who signed a deal to manage the Royals until June 2027 and brought James Beattie and Danny Shcolfield to the Select Car Leasing Stadium as part of his coaching staff. More news! Andoni Iraola, David Moyes, Thomas Frank and the beleaguered Vitor Perira are all due to rock the pre-match mic about now. Having masterminded just one win in seven games ahead of Everton’s trip to Sunderland’s Stadium of Light on Monday night, is it too soon to suggest that the Moyes rump might be inching closer to the bacon slicer? I predicted relegation for Everton on the Guardian Football Weekly podcast before a ball was kicked this season and was absolutely hammered for it by irate Toffees on social media. I’ve since been surprised by how decent they look at times with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye on either flank, but they really need to get one or both of their underperforming strikers firing. Going on the evidence of what we’ve seen so far from Beto and Thierno Barry this season, it’s a big IF. Everton have already lost against one promoted side in Leeds, if they were to lose to another on Monday, their fans might start getting restless. Brighton v Leeds United: Daniel Farke staged his pre-match press conference yesterday and said that apart from Willy Gnonto, who is back in training after surgery on a hernia, his squad has a clean bill of health going into tomorrow’s match on the south coast. Several Leeds players had been laid low with an illness last week. Gabriel Gudmonson is also available after recovering from a dead leg he suffered in Leeds’ win over West Ham last Friday. “We are in a way better position,” he said. “I have nothing to report or complain about. Everyone is training and available.” Farke said he was reasonably happy with the 11 points his side have hoovered up so far from their nine games this season but added that they should have more. “I would be a bit more relaxed if we had taken all the points we deserved from those matches,” he said. “We should be on 15 to 17 points already and, if that was the case, the sun would shine even more. We’re on a good path, but survival isn’t a guarantee. We need around nine or 10 wins to stay up.” Arsenal injury news: Mikel Arteta told reporters that William Saliba remains a doubt after missing his side’s Carabao Cup win over Brighton, while Gabriel Martinelli is definitely out for tomorrow’s trip to Turf Moor. Arteta was pleased to report that Noni Madueke, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz are all expectedf to be fit for the north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday 23 November, following the next interational break. Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea: Spurs host Chelsea in what recent history suggests could be a right old ding-dong tomorrow evening, not least due to Chelsea’s almost chronic inability to keep their full complement of players on the pitch. Despite being third in the table, questions remain over Tottenham under Thomas Frank with detractors pointing out that the fixture list has been kind to them so far. Spurs have “only” beaten Burnley, Manchester City, West Ham, Leeds and Everton. In Chelsea, they welcome a team who have won on five of their six visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. “Tottenham are doing very good, they won the Europa League last season and started good this season,” said Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca. “Because it’s a derby it will for sure be a difficult game.” Insightful stuff, there. Burnley v Arsenal: Mikel Arteta has also had his say on the fact that none of the promoted sides are in the relegation zone after nine rounds of matches. “More than ever the level is increasing, year after year,” he said. “Better structure, better organisation, better decision-making from clubs and managers, better players. It tells you the difficulty of that. When you look at teams and the way they have behaved - how they have earned points or lost points - it is because of small margins. That is the reality in this league.” Brighton v Leeds: Brighton host Leeds at the Amex Stadium tomorrow afternoon and ahead of the game, Hurzeler was asked if he is surprised by how well Daniel Farke’s side have done since winning promotion from the second tier. Leeds currently sit in 15th place, six points clear of a drop zone in which all three promoted sides are conspicuous by their absence. “For me it’s not a surprise,” he said. “If you saw Leeds playing last season in the Championship it was already impressive. Then of course they have added new players - everyone who has been promoted this season has spent good money, especially like Sunderland. They’re all doing well which means the league is getting more and more competitive and equal. Just look at the table to see how close it is - a sign that the league is getting more and more competitive.” Brighton v Leeds: Can Brighton’s evergreen striker Danny Welbeck, 34, play for England? His head coach Fabian Hurzeler and teammates seem to think so. “I just asked the question to the squad whether Danny can play for England and they all agreed,” said the German during his press conference this morning. “That was the only time we’ve mentioned it. Let’s see what happens. I’m very convinced for my players and I have a big belief that Danny will be able to play for England but I always try to emphasise that England has a great coach and he will make the right decisions. Let’s see.” Obviously, press conference quotes can often be regurgitated out of context by unscrupulous journalists but one presumes Hurzeler was asking his players if they think Welbeck is still good enough to play for England and wasn’t looking for their permission to let him do so in the event of a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Welbeck has represented his country 42 times but last played for them in a 1-0 friendly win over Switzerland in September 2018, more than seven years ago. He was replaced after 61 minutes at Wembley by Jesse Lingard. That’s the end of my spell. I’m off for a cuppa. So here’s Barry Glendenning to take the reins. Here’s a bit more from Arteta on his selection dilemmas amid the increase in depth at Arsenal this season: In terms of the decision with certain players when you don’t allow them to play, [it] is the hardest part in our job. But they acknowledge that as well. At the end, when they make decisions – some good, some bad – I don’t judge them on every decision that they make. We cannot do that. So the other way around, this cannot happen. We are dealing with it in a really positive way and you can see the consequences in the impact that every player who is not playing is having when they play – the way they are performing. The way you do that is by good preparation and a good mental state. Uefa has confirmed it has received declarations of interest from 15 different venues associations to host the 2028 and 2029 Champions League, Europa League, Conference League and Women’s Champions League finals. Although these are not binding at this stage – and final bids must be submitted by 10 June next year – it seems the 2028 men’s Champions League final will be staged in Munich as that is the only current bidder, with Wembley and the Camp Nou the main contenders to host it in 2029. Cardiff and Dublin are among the contenders to stage the 2029 Women’s Champions League final, with Lyon, Bilbao, Basel and Istanbul the 2028 bidders. There are a whole host of bidders for the 2028 and 2029 Europa League and Conference League finals, from countries like France, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland and Romania, among others. 10 things! From Burnley’s Q, Arne Slot’s selection issues, to Jordan Pickford’s joyous return to Wearside: Mikel Arteta has warned that clubs could consider pulling out of competitions if fixture congestion is not resolved. The EFL has yet to confirm when Arsenal’s Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace will take place, with 16 December having been earmarked. A game then would leave Palace facing three fixtures in five days, and talks are understood to be ongoing over when the game will be scheduled. “Every decision that we make in terms of a fixture has to be guided on two main things: player welfare and then supporters,” Arteta said. “That’s it. And the rest has to come very, very far away from that.” Asked whether big clubs could decide to prioritise some competitions if the problem gets worse, the Arsenal manager said: “I hope we don’t go [that far]. If we have that big piece of paper with those two principles there in front before we make any decision, all of us in our industry, we won’t get there. If we don’t and we just ignore that, then anything is possible.” I’m not sure whether to be impressed or depressed by this. One day in the off season, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, ‘what is Seattle Reign’s identity?’ And it would spurt it out. And I was like ‘I don’t know if that’s true or not. And then I put in ‘what formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?’ and it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went ‘you should play a back five.’ So I did. No joke, that’s why I did it. Newcastle fans have been hoping to see summer signing Yoane Wissa in action soon, but Howe’s latest update on the former Brentford striker was not overly optimistic. He said: “He’s on the grass and working but he definitely won’t be involved on Sunday. I’d say he’s not close to training with the group due to fitness. I’m not trying to be evasive but I don’t know when the moment will be when he’s back with the squad.” Oh dear. Eddie Howe is up next. And the Newcastle manager has been saying what everyone else has been thinking about their weekend opponents, West Ham. The thing I would say from looking at the squad they have got is they have a group of very good players. There is no doubting the quality of the players they have got, especially in attacking areas. Lucas Paquetá, Jarrod Bowen, Niclas Füllkrug… yep West Ham do have some top players. So why have they been so bad this season? They’ve got four points, and one win, in nine games this term. There’s been a bit of back-and-forth between Amorim and Sean Dyche – largely over comments Dyche made a while back, claiming he “bet [he] could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2,” amid that ongoing debate about Amorim’s 3-4-3. “Maybe it’s true that if we play 4-4-2 we win more games,” Amorim said. “But I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while, but in the future it’s going to be better. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and as a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don’t say very strong things, I don’t want to watch you. So I understand that it’s a completely different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.” Dyche did clarify his comments. The Nottingham Forest boss added: “Clickbait kills everything, it changes the whole story. I’m sure Man United have got a big enough press department to watch that whole interview, because I equally said managers should be given time.” Here’s what Amorim said about his year in the Manchester United hot-seat: It was a journey, a big journey. It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments. I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago. One of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years. It’s hard to believe it’s almost been a year since Manchester United appointed Ruben Amorim. After three successive wins of late, including that first victory at Anfield against Liverpool for almost 10 years, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS’s faith in Amorim suddenly feels farsighted. Rob Draper has dived deeper into the past 12 months at Old Trafford. And in the upcoming posts we’ll hear what Amorim said in his press conference before United’s trip to Nottingham Forest tomorrow. West Ham midfielder Lucas Paquetá has been reprimanded and warned as to his future conduct over his failure to co-operate with a Football Association investigation into spot-fixing allegations. Paquetá was cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent commission in July, but the commission did find he had failed to comply with a requirement to answer questions and provide information to the FA’s investigation. The FA later confirmed it would not appeal against the commission’s decision to clear the Brazilian of the four spot-fixing charges. PA Media Cheers Yara. There are loads more Premier League press conferences for us to get stuck into this morning … My short stint has come to an end but Dominic Booth is here to bring you the latest. Newcastle: More from Howe on the challenge of West Ham, who are winless since 31 August. They have a group of very good players, especially in the attacking areas, we are going to have our work cut out to limit the space for their attacking talent. Our away form has not been strong enough and we want to put that right in this game. And on the possibility of winning back-to-back games: It would be huge for us. It’s only with back-to-back wins that we are going to propel ourselves. It’s so tight. There are a lot of teams congested where we are, you are looking for one positive result to try to elevate you. Newcastle: Eddie Howe has given an update on Lewis Hall and the rest of his squad’s fitness ahead of Sunday’s trip to West Ham. [Lewis Hall] is very close. He hasn’t trained with us yet so hopefully he will be training with us today for the first time. We will see how he looks. I think he has worked really hard. He has looked after himself and looks in really good shape. But then we have to reintroduce himself back into the squad at the right time. I don’t think there is anything new. We are still managing Will Osula’s ankle problem. We will see how he is today, but apart from that I think we are as we were. FA Cup: A quick turn to tonight’s meeting between Luton Town and Forest Green Rovers in the FA Cup first round. Both sides will wear kits made by the eco-conscious brand Reflo and to mark the occasion, Reflo says it will plant 1,000 trees for every goal scored at Kenilworth Road, with a minimum of 1,000 trees guaranteed regardless of the result. The initiative is designed to highlight the growing intersection between football and environmental responsibility, particularly among clubs that have made sustainability part of their identity. Forest Green Rovers, long known as the world’s first fully vegan football club, are celebrating ten years since that milestone this season. Their kits are also certified by the Vegan Society. Luton Town have launched tree-planting schemes of their own as part of their broader push toward greener practices, including plans for an environmentally conscious new stadium at Power Court. On the pitch, two former Premier League players-turned-managers, Jack Wilshere and Robbie Savage, face off in the dugouts with a spot in the second round and a few thousand trees at stake. Liverpool: The defending champions take on Villa this weekend before hosting Real Madrid in the Champions League. Their final game before the November international break will be away to Manchester City. Here is what Slot said on the challenge Villa posses: If you don’t win the beginning, people say: ‘oh maybe they don’t have the same team as last season’ and then they start winning and everything is positive again. Where with us, it’s exactly the opposite. We’re both on the same points, apart from Arsenal many teams are in and around the same points. It shows how hard the Premier League is. They’ve done very well in the last six or seven games. And maybe it’s not a surprise and you could see in the games they lost before the signs that they are a very good team. They decided not to make a habit out of having more chances than the opponent and not win it. Let’s make sure we don’t have that habit. The Dutchman also provided some team news: Ryan [Gravenberch] trained with us yesterday. The other two [Curtis Jones and Alexander Isak] not yet. In the end bit of an injury, things can slow down. Let’s see where the other two are. Ryan trained with us for the first time yesterday, and will train with us today. Then we’ll make the call to see if he can start or not. The other two are probably 99.9% not in the squad on Saturday. Liverpool: Slot is also asked whether he and the club are in negotiations for a contract extension. This is the last question that I was expecting. My focus is completely on getting Liverpool back to winning ways. That is my first answer and my second answer, contract talks, if they are even there, we never speak about this here. Let us first start to win again, that is my main focus. Liverpool: More from Slot on finding form. The thing that gives me the most confidence is the quality in the players and the chances these players are creating. This will result in the players scoring more goals than we have up until now. We have to address other things. But if I talk about that and speak about them, people tell me I’m using excuses. So maybe it’s best that I just say that. There are other positives to go int this week – quality of the players first and foremost and the amount of chances we created from open play is enough to compete for the positions we want to compete for. The Liverpool manager Arne Slot was asked whether he feels his squad depth is the reason his side have lost six of their last seven matches. We miss nothing. I’m happy with the quality of the team. But I’m also convinced by the strategy and policy we have. What makes it ‘the issue’ – not all of them have had a proper pre-season. When three or four are injured, you go down to having 16 players. I am a firm believer in 21 or 22 players are enough. But you have to keep them fit as we did last season. We are struggling to keep them fit this season for in my opinion, obvious reasons. [Alexander Isak] came to us on 1 September. A few others missed out in pre-season. It has been more difficult than last season to keep them more available. When players are not available, it [workload] comes down more to the same players. But no excuses for results. We had to play a lot of away games with only two days in between. That would have been difficult last season, and for any player that has been fit this season through pre-season. But it has not been the case this season. Then you have to manage it. The upcoming week is three games in eight days. It has nothing to do with squad depth, but it has how we have run through the season in terms of injuries, availability every two or three days. Another spine-tingling weekend of football is upon us. Join us as we preview a frightful round of fixtures from the Premier League, FA Cup, Women’s Super League and more with team news and key press conferences.

While Manchester City\\u2019s manager added that \\u201ceveryone can beat anyone\\u201d, there has been a dominant side: his, as apart from last term when Liverpool were champions, City claimed the title for in a record four consecutive years - 2020-21 to \\u201823-24. Guardiola\\u2019s point may be that in those seasons Liverpool and Arsenal were always serious challengers to City.<\\/p> <p>He said: \\u201cThe Premier League has always been like this, all the teams can beat each other, it is good. At some point like the NBA, there is not a dominant team in the last four or five or six years. There is always one different team and everyone can beat everyone. I think for the spectator and for the show of the Premier League it is really, really good.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI remember when I was in [Bayern] Munich or Barcelona, I always heard the rumours that in England, everyone could beat everyone. I always had that sense. Maybe Liverpool and ourselves in the past changed that dynamic because we were so consistent in terms of points and arriving every season with 90, 90, 90 points, close to 100 points.\\u201d<\\/p> <p>While the NBA has been claimed by six different franchises since 2020 - the LA Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma Thunder \\u2013 Guardiola believes City are close to being near their very best again.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cStill, we are not at our best, but we are close. I think I had the feeling, I said a month ago that these words would be completely devastating if you don\\u2019t get results. I know that, but I had the feeling when I see the team, when I see in the dressing room, in the trainings, and how we apply, how we want to try to do things, I had the feeling,\\u201d said the manager. \\u201c[And] that when I think Rodri can come [to] his best, that he will not be soon at his best, but he can help us, and alongside all the alternatives I can have, we will be a team that will be difficult for the opponents to beat us, and this is what I want. Will we be still close to the fight [for the title then]?

It has nothing to do with squad depth, but it has how we have run through the season in terms of injuries, availability every two or three days.<\\/p> <\\/blockquote> <\\/div>   <p class=\\\"block-time updated-time\\\">Updated <time datetime=\\\"2025-10-31T09:41:19.394Z\\\">at 9.41am GMT<\\/time><\\/p>  <\\/div> <div id=\\\"block-6900d7908f0834dc8678fb3a\\\" class=\\\"block is-key-event\\\" data-block-contributor=\\\"\\\"> <p class=\\\"block-time published-time\\\"> <time datetime=\\\"2025-10-31T09:35:46.819Z\\\">9.35am <span class=\\\"timezone\\\">GMT<\\/span><\\/time> <\\/p>   <h2 class=\\\"block-title\\\">Preamble<\\/h2>  <div class=\\\"block-elements\\\">  <p>Another spine-tingling weekend of football is upon us.

Fulham v Wolves is that six-pointer, with the pressure far more on the Wolves manager than Marco Silva. Wolves won this one last season, courtesy of Matheus Cunha. It still didn\\u2019t save Gary O\\u2019Neil. Sunday will see Manchester City v Bournemouth, and there\\u2019s a mutual appreciation society developing between Pep Guardiola and Andoni Iraola. The latter seems to be mastering the art of staying humble. Iraola said: \\u201cI want City to win every game, I want Liverpool to win every game, I want Arsenal to win every game - those are not our rivals. When they face other teams, I don\\u2019t want them to lose any points. It\\u2019s not because for one week we could be a little bit ahead. At the end of the season, we know we are not going to be there with those teams. We will be in another fight. \\u201cThey have Haaland, who is probably better than ever, scoring a lot of goals. It\\u2019s not about only Haaland. The problem is, you focus too much on Haaland, and they have tons of players - I think (Omar) Marmoush, every time he plays against us scores, for example.\\u201d Here\\u2019s your weekend ahead on the website. As ever, it\\u2019s ram-packed. Oliver Glasner is often a calm customer, but Crystal Palace\\u2019s fixture pile-up has revealed an angrier side. His team face a Carabao Cup quarter-final on Tuesday 16 or Wednesday 17 December but, with Palace hosting the Finnish side KuPS at on 18 December in the Conference League, the tie at the Emirates Stadium being played on Tuesday leaves Palace playing twice in 54 hours. Arsenal are unlikely to agree to playing the cup game on 23 December. Glasner isn\\u2019t happy: \\u201c\\u201cHonestly, I can\\u2019t believe that it will be fixed in that way. I think it would be irresponsible for the players. And everybody has a responsibility for the players. And we have to look after their welfare. That\\u2019s our main responsibility - and not just at the club. \\u201cWhen I heard it for the first time yesterday [Thursday], I couldn\\u2019t believe it that they are considering this. I\\u2019m really upset - because I spoke about this issue three months ago when I looked at the schedule. In the summer, in the off-season, there are people who have to work on the schedule. \\u201cI would really prefer if they talk together. It would be nice if Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and the EFL talked together because it\\u2019s not so surprising that this can happen. And now they\\u2019re finding something where you can\\u2019t find a solution? Get it organised and sorted before. This makes me really upset.\\u201d Some more Nuno on West Ham. This won\\u2019t enthuse Hammers fans, as he discusses team selections that have confounded them. \\u201cIt\\u2019s something that doesn\\u2019t please us, something that personally I don\\u2019t like. I would like to have found a solution earlier and stick to it, but I think it\\u2019s our obligation to try and find the solutions because the team is not producing. We started with Andy [Irving] and Tomas [Soucek] against Leeds and it didn\\u2019t quite work. The second half was better, so we are still looking. I hope that we can solve all the problems faster than we are solving them. It\\u2019s going to take a very long time, but honestly I wish that we can stick with one and the team clicks and it goes well so we can move forward.\\u201d Here\\u2019s Jamie Jackson on that festive fixture news. Sad news reaches us of the death of Colin Addison, a name you might recall from probably the greatest FA Cup shock of all, non-league Hereford United beating Newcastle 2-1 in 1972, as the club\\u2019s player-manager. Addison also coached Celta Vigo and Atletico Madrid, as a exceedingly well-travelled coach. He also played for York, Nottingham Forest, Arsenal and Sheffield United. He was 85. He spoke to Jamie Jackson in 2007 for the below piece. Every day I walk through the town someone mentions it. I\\u2019m from Somerset, but I\\u2019m adopted here. They named a street after me, Addison Court. That was nice. Five years ago I went back to St James\\u2019 Park for the first time. I saw Malcolm Macdonald. The fag fell out his mouth and he said: \\u2018Fucking hell, not you again!\\u2019 Alex Whitney gets in touch: \\u201cThere has been, understandably, a lot of talk about the (arguably) bigger teams struggling against low blocks this season. Arsenal relying on too many set piece goals as a result, etc etc. But tell me - which teams have recently been playing well against low blocks? Aside from De Bruyne-era City, can someone enlighten me as to who Chelsea in this example should model themselves after?\\u201d Here\\u2019s our collation of the weekend tean news. The Premier League has announced the festive season fixture schedule. There will be just one match on Boxing Day, Manchester United taking on Newcastle, a Friday night fixture at 8pm, with a full weekend to follow. Further match days follow on 30 December, where six matches will be played in the evening, and then four on 1 January. After that, games over the weekend of 3 and 4 January, and then a midweek round played over Tuesday 6 January, Wednesday 7 January. To close out, on 8 January, Arsenal v Liverpool. And then it\\u2019s the FA Cup\\u2026 All the details here Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Football Daily, on the touchy subject of AI, penned by, well, me actually. Jacob Steinberg previews Saturday\\u2019s west London derby. This is a hard game to read. Spurs are five points off first place and unbeaten in the Champions League. Chelsea are world champions and reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup this week. However, fans of both sides remain unconvinced by Frank and Maresca. Spurs supporters have grumbled about a lack of creativity when the onus is on their team to attack; Chelsea\\u2019s moan about their young side\\u2019s immaturity, indiscipline and toils against low blocks. Fulham v Wolves on Saturday has the look of a relegation six-pointer, with Marco Silva\\u2019s team losing the last four matches. They have suffered for their lack of signings last summer. Silva isn\\u2019t quite using Brendan Rodgers\\u2019 \\u201cHonda Civic\\u201d metaphor but the message to owner Shad Khan is fairly explicit. \\u201cSomething we didn\\u2019t do in August, we should have done. It\\u2019s not the moment to talk about it. With all our players, we will be strong and competitive. But results speak louder. We have to be prepared for January.\\u201d Cristian Romero will be back for Tottenham when they face Chelsea tomorrow evening. Thomas Frank: \\u201cThe positive news is that Romero, Destiny (Udogie) and Wilson (Odobert) are available for selection for Saturday. I am very aware of trying to be able to take the best possible decisions. Of course in the end I will get a lot of information from medical staff, performance staff, but in the end it is always on me. \\u201cIf a player breaks down, it is on me. It is not on the medical staff, not on the performance staff, always me. I take decisions, I get all the information and then I have to take a difficult choice or a braver choice, or an easy choice, so that is it. If Romero was fit enough, he would have been involved on Wednesday (against Newcastle), but he is ready to be involved and let\\u2019s see how he is.\\u201d Pep has also been talking about his assistants. \\u201cI think not me, Man City, Pep Lijnders and Kolo [Toure] and James [French] on set-pieces, it is a joy to work with them. It is a joy to work with them and I am so happy. I was in the past but we are talking this season. \\u201cI am learning a lot. The most important thing for me is people that can add something to my knowledge as a manager and I have it. We talk a lot and that is so nice because it is why you are a manager. Football is not just the pleasure of playing, it is to talk as well and how we can help the team. I feel embrace for all of them and that is all I can ask.\\u201d Pep Guardiola has compared the Premier League\\u2019s competitiveness to the NBA (America\\u2019s National Basketball Association) due to there being \\u201cno dominant team in the last four or six years\\u201d. While Manchester City\\u2019s manager added that \\u201ceveryone can beat anyone\\u201d, there has been a dominant side: his, as apart from last term when Liverpool were champions, City claimed the title for in a record four consecutive years - 2020-21 to \\u201823-24. Guardiola\\u2019s point may be that in those seasons Liverpool and Arsenal were always serious challengers to City. He said: \\u201cThe Premier League has always been like this, all the teams can beat each other, it is good. At some point like the NBA, there is not a dominant team in the last four or five or six years. There is always one different team and everyone can beat everyone. I think for the spectator and for the show of the Premier League it is really, really good. \\u201cI remember when I was in [Bayern] Munich or Barcelona, I always heard the rumours that in England, everyone could beat everyone. I always had that sense. Maybe Liverpool and ourselves in the past changed that dynamic because we were so consistent in terms of points and arriving every season with 90, 90, 90 points, close to 100 points.\\u201d While the NBA has been claimed by six different franchises since 2020 - the LA Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma Thunder \\u2013 Guardiola believes City are close to being near their very best again. \\u201cStill, we are not at our best, but we are close. I think I had the feeling, I said a month ago that these words would be completely devastating if you don\\u2019t get results. I know that, but I had the feeling when I see the team, when I see in the dressing room, in the trainings, and how we apply, how we want to try to do things, I had the feeling,\\u201d said the manager. \\u201c[And] that when I think Rodri can come [to] his best, that he will not be soon at his best, but he can help us, and alongside all the alternatives I can have, we will be a team that will be difficult for the opponents to beat us, and this is what I want. Will we be still close to the fight [for the title then]? I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d City are in fifth place, six points behind Arsenal, and host second-place Bournemouth in Sunday\\u2019s late game. Guardiola said that Rodri may be available to play some part following a hamstring problem. \\u201cI think he will be ready to help us. I dunno from the beginning but hopefully with us,\\u201d said the manager. Handover: John Brewin is here to see you down the home straight. Be gentle with him. Leeds United: Ao Tanaka has been told not to be too self-critical by his manager Daniel Farke after the Japan midfielder claimed he was currently \\u201cnot good enough\\u201d for the Premier League. Tanaka gave a harsh appraisal of his own performance in last week\\u2019s home win against West Ham in a radio interview, having returned to the starting line-up following a spell out through injury. The 27-year-old sustained an MCL injury in the 5-0 defeat at Arsenal in August and then had to be patient due to the form of Sean Longstaff and Anton Stach in his absence. \\u201cI like it if someone is humble and self-critical and puts the crossbar for his demands really high,\\u201d said Farke. \\u201cI quite like that because normally in this business it\\u2019s the other way round. But he doesn\\u2019t have to say this, not at all. There\\u2019s no reason to be so self-critical because Ao was fantastic for us in the Championship and it\\u2019s his first time in a top division and he has a point to prove there.\\u201d Farke said Tanaka was in his starting line-up for the opening-day win against Everton after \\u201ca fantastic pre-season\\u201d and cannot be blamed for his injury. PA Media Burnley v Arsenal: Scott Parker believes Burnley can take confidence from their previous clashes with the Premier League\\u2019s elite sides ahead of tomorrow\\u2019s meeting with table-topping Arsenal. Burnley have already faced Tottenham, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City since their return to the top flight this summer and have lost all four games. They did, however, run both Liverpool and Manchester United very close. \\u201cEvery single game we\\u2019ve been involved in this [season], there have been parts of games where I look at us and I think, \\u2018We\\u2019re hugely competitive here, we\\u2019re right in this game\\u2019,\\u201d said Parker. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a squad constantly learning, I do see a progression. At the weekend [a 3-2 win at Wolves] I thought it was the best we\\u2019ve played with the ball. It\\u2019s those experiences that we\\u2019ve been through that are improving us and hopefully we keep nudging on.\\u201d Burnley have beaten Sunderland, Leeds and Wolves this season and Parker has called on home fans to play their part at Turf Moor this weekend. \\u201cWhile we\\u2019re up against a very good team, we need to have a real understanding of what this team don\\u2019t want to face,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to need to bring absolutely humongous energy into this stadium, our players are going to need to bring unbelievable spirit, and, with that, we\\u2019ll try and make it as uncomfortable [as we can] and try and get a result.\\u201d Fulham v Wolves: Although you wouldn\\u2019t know it going by their results, Vitor Pereira is convinced he has the solution to his side\\u2019s woes and knows exactly what they need to do to drag themselves away from the foot of the table. \\u201cI know a way to change the current situation and the answer is to work hard every day,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to convince my team that we have quality and convince them to keep their energy up. We have to go into the next game against Fulham with ambition. We have to increase our tactical organisation. We need to keep fighting because I think we deserve a result from the way that we work.\\u201d To be fair, I\\u2019m inclined to agree with Vitor. While Wolves are no great shakes, I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re among the three worst sides in the top flight, despite their lowly status. I also think they\\u2019re due a win and will see off Fulham tomorrow afternoon but other opinions are available. Fulham v Wolves: Bottom of the table and still looking for their first win of the season, Wolves got knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Chelsea in midweek, despite a spirited comeback after going 3-0 down. Last weekend, Wolves lost another nail-biter against Burnley, losing 3-2 in added time after overturning a two-goal deficit. Following that particular game, both Jorgen Strand Larsen and the team\\u2019s head coach Vitor Pereira had to be ushered away from unhappy fans after Getting Into It with them in an impromptu post-match debrief. \\u201cJorgen went over to thank the supporters,\\u201d said Pereira this afternoon, when asked about the incident. \\u201cI felt my players gave everything to win the game, but right at the end they committed a mistake to lose the game. \\u201cI went over to explain that we are fighting and fighting, but we must fight together. I understand the frustration [from the fans] because I\\u2019m also frustrated. The Carabao Cup result wasn\\u2019t the result we wanted either, but I felt a connection between the supporters and the team again, which is important to me.\\u201d West Ham v Newcastle United: Yet to win under Nuno Espirito Santo, their second manager of the season, West Ham host Newcastle on Sunday afternoon and their Portuguese head coach, who already has about him the air of a man who knows he\\u2019s made a terrible error of judgement in taking over from Graham Potter, has been issuing some team news. Central defender Konstantinos Mavropanos will be out for \\u201canother couple of weeks\\u201d with a thigh injury, while Oliver Scarles will be sidelined until December after undergoing surgery on a shoulder injury. German striker Niclas Fullkrug also remains absent with a thigh injury. Sunderland v Everton: Having come up through the playoffs, Sunderland are riding high in fourth place and host Everton on Monday night at the Stadium of Light in a match many people will be expecting them to win. In Enzo Le Fez, Noah Sadiki, Nordi Mukiele, Habib Diarra and Chemsine Talbi, to name but a few of their 14 summer signings, the eartly signs suggest that Sunderland did some excellent business in the transfer window over the summer but arguably the pick of the bunch of new recruits, given the experience he brings to this young squad, has been Granit Xhaka. The Swiss veteran\\u2019s arrival at the Stadium of Light from Bayer Leverkusen raised more than a few eyebrows and Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris has been talking up the club captain. \\u201cTo be competitive at that level, you need to own the performance on the pitch,\\u201d he said. \\u201cGranit helps a lot because he can manage different elements on the pitch. He\\u2019s not alone but he gives hope and faith that we can win. He shows it, tells it in the dressing room. The target as a coach is this, you don\\u2019t want to be the main man, this is not my purpose. I want to give knowledge, power, responsibility to the squad because you have to manage the game in real time. We have other players on the pitch able to manage micro situations, not just Granit. We are able to improve our level, to be more flexible and more adaptable.\\u201d Reading: Sacked from his position as head coach last weekend after a 1-1 draw with Doncaster left Reading 19th in League One, Noel Hunt has released a statement through the League Managers\\u2019 Association. \\u201cI am disappointed to have left the club so early into the League One season, especially with so much still to play for,\\u201d it says. \\u201cWhen I took over as manager of Reading almost a year ago, the club was facing an incredibly difficult and uncertain period. The ownership situation was unstable, we were operating under a transfer embargo, and we had lost several key members of the squad. At that time, the very survival of the club was in jeopardy. \\u201cDespite those challenges, I am immensely proud of the progress we made together \\u2013 stabilising the club, rebuilding belief, and creating a strong and united team that came within touching distance of the play-offs on the final day of the season. \\u201cOver the summer, we had hoped to build on those foundations. Unfortunately, circumstances meant we once again faced the huge task of rebuilding, with 15 players and key members of my backroom staff leaving before pre-season began. \\u201cEven so, I was confident in the group we were developing. The squad was growing stronger each week, and with 32 league games still to play, I truly believed we were on the path to a successful season. While I am naturally disappointed by the club\\u2019s decision, I would like to thank everyone connected with Reading Football Club \\u2013 the staff, my coaching team, and especially the players \\u2013 for their loyalty, hard work, and professionalism throughout my time there.\\u201d Hunt has been replaced by Leam Richardson, 45, who signed a deal to manage the Royals until June 2027 and brought James Beattie and Danny Shcolfield to the Select Car Leasing Stadium as part of his coaching staff. More news! Andoni Iraola, David Moyes, Thomas Frank and the beleaguered Vitor Perira are all due to rock the pre-match mic about now. Having masterminded just one win in seven games ahead of Everton\\u2019s trip to Sunderland\\u2019s Stadium of Light on Monday night, is it too soon to suggest that the Moyes rump might be inching closer to the bacon slicer? I predicted relegation for Everton on the Guardian Football Weekly podcast before a ball was kicked this season and was absolutely hammered for it by irate Toffees on social media. I\\u2019ve since been surprised by how decent they look at times with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye on either flank, but they really need to get one or both of their underperforming strikers firing. Going on the evidence of what we\\u2019ve seen so far from Beto and Thierno Barry this season, it\\u2019s a big IF. Everton have already lost against one promoted side in Leeds, if they were to lose to another on Monday, their fans might start getting restless. Brighton v Leeds United: Daniel Farke staged his pre-match press conference yesterday and said that apart from Willy Gnonto, who is back in training after surgery on a hernia, his squad has a clean bill of health going into tomorrow\\u2019s match on the south coast. Several Leeds players had been laid low with an illness last week. Gabriel Gudmonson is also available after recovering from a dead leg he suffered in Leeds\\u2019 win over West Ham last Friday. \\u201cWe are in a way better position,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have nothing to report or complain about. Everyone is training and available.\\u201d Farke said he was reasonably happy with the 11 points his side have hoovered up so far from their nine games this season but added that they should have more. \\u201cI would be a bit more relaxed if we had taken all the points we deserved from those matches,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe should be on 15 to 17 points already and, if that was the case, the sun would shine even more. We\\u2019re on a good path, but survival isn\\u2019t a guarantee. We need around nine or 10 wins to stay up.\\u201d Arsenal injury news: Mikel Arteta told reporters that William Saliba remains a doubt after missing his side\\u2019s Carabao Cup win over Brighton, while Gabriel Martinelli is definitely out for tomorrow\\u2019s trip to Turf Moor. Arteta was pleased to report that Noni Madueke, Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz are all expectedf to be fit for the north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday 23 November, following the next interational break. Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea: Spurs host Chelsea in what recent history suggests could be a right old ding-dong tomorrow evening, not least due to Chelsea\\u2019s almost chronic inability to keep their full complement of players on the pitch. Despite being third in the table, questions remain over Tottenham under Thomas Frank with detractors pointing out that the fixture list has been kind to them so far. Spurs have \\u201conly\\u201d beaten Burnley, Manchester City, West Ham, Leeds and Everton. In Chelsea, they welcome a team who have won on five of their six visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \\u201cTottenham are doing very good, they won the Europa League last season and started good this season,\\u201d said Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca. \\u201cBecause it\\u2019s a derby it will for sure be a difficult game.\\u201d Insightful stuff, there. Burnley v Arsenal: Mikel Arteta has also had his say on the fact that none of the promoted sides are in the relegation zone after nine rounds of matches. \\u201cMore than ever the level is increasing, year after year,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBetter structure, better organisation, better decision-making from clubs and managers, better players. It tells you the difficulty of that. When you look at teams and the way they have behaved - how they have earned points or lost points - it is because of small margins. That is the reality in this league.\\u201d Brighton v Leeds: Brighton host Leeds at the Amex Stadium tomorrow afternoon and ahead of the game, Hurzeler was asked if he is surprised by how well Daniel Farke\\u2019s side have done since winning promotion from the second tier. Leeds currently sit in 15th place, six points clear of a drop zone in which all three promoted sides are conspicuous by their absence. \\u201cFor me it\\u2019s not a surprise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf you saw Leeds playing last season in the Championship it was already impressive. Then of course they have added new players - everyone who has been promoted this season has spent good money, especially like Sunderland. They\\u2019re all doing well which means the league is getting more and more competitive and equal. Just look at the table to see how close it is - a sign that the league is getting more and more competitive.\\u201d Brighton v Leeds: Can Brighton\\u2019s evergreen striker Danny Welbeck, 34, play for England? His head coach Fabian Hurzeler and teammates seem to think so. \\u201cI just asked the question to the squad whether Danny can play for England and they all agreed,\\u201d said the German during his press conference this morning. \\u201cThat was the only time we\\u2019ve mentioned it. Let\\u2019s see what happens. I\\u2019m very convinced for my players and I have a big belief that Danny will be able to play for England but I always try to emphasise that England has a great coach and he will make the right decisions. Let\\u2019s see.\\u201d Obviously, press conference quotes can often be regurgitated out of context by unscrupulous journalists but one presumes Hurzeler was asking his players if they think Welbeck is still good enough to play for England and wasn\\u2019t looking for their permission to let him do so in the event of a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Welbeck has represented his country 42 times but last played for them in a 1-0 friendly win over Switzerland in September 2018, more than seven years ago. He was replaced after 61 minutes at Wembley by Jesse Lingard. That\\u2019s the end of my spell. I\\u2019m off for a cuppa. So here\\u2019s Barry Glendenning to take the reins. Here\\u2019s a bit more from Arteta on his selection dilemmas amid the increase in depth at Arsenal this season: In terms of the decision with certain players when you don\\u2019t allow them to play, [it] is the hardest part in our job. But they acknowledge that as well. At the end, when they make decisions \\u2013 some good, some bad \\u2013 I don\\u2019t judge them on every decision that they make. We cannot do that. So the other way around, this cannot happen. We are dealing with it in a really positive way and you can see the consequences in the impact that every player who is not playing is having when they play \\u2013 the way they are performing. The way you do that is by good preparation and a good mental state. Uefa has confirmed it has received declarations of interest from 15 different venues associations to host the 2028 and 2029 Champions League, Europa League, Conference League and Women\\u2019s Champions League finals. Although these are not binding at this stage \\u2013 and final bids must be submitted by 10 June next year \\u2013 it seems the 2028 men\\u2019s Champions League final will be staged in Munich as that is the only current bidder, with Wembley and the Camp Nou the main contenders to host it in 2029. Cardiff and Dublin are among the contenders to stage the 2029 Women\\u2019s Champions League final, with Lyon, Bilbao, Basel and Istanbul the 2028 bidders. There are a whole host of bidders for the 2028 and 2029 Europa League and Conference League finals, from countries like France, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Poland and Romania, among others. 10 things! From Burnley\\u2019s Q, Arne Slot\\u2019s selection issues, to Jordan Pickford\\u2019s joyous return to Wearside: Mikel Arteta has warned that clubs could consider pulling out of competitions if fixture congestion is not resolved. The EFL has yet to confirm when Arsenal\\u2019s Carabao Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace will take place, with 16 December having been earmarked. A game then would leave Palace facing three fixtures in five days, and talks are understood to be ongoing over when the game will be scheduled. \\u201cEvery decision that we make in terms of a fixture has to be guided on two main things: player welfare and then supporters,\\u201d Arteta said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. And the rest has to come very, very far away from that.\\u201d Asked whether big clubs could decide to prioritise some competitions if the problem gets worse, the Arsenal manager said: \\u201cI hope we don\\u2019t go [that far]. If we have that big piece of paper with those two principles there in front before we make any decision, all of us in our industry, we won\\u2019t get there. If we don\\u2019t and we just ignore that, then anything is possible.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure whether to be impressed or depressed by this. One day in the off season, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, \\u2018what is Seattle Reign\\u2019s identity?\\u2019 And it would spurt it out. And I was like \\u2018I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s true or not. And then I put in \\u2018what formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?\\u2019 and it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went \\u2018you should play a back five.\\u2019 So I did. No joke, that\\u2019s why I did it. Newcastle fans have been hoping to see summer signing Yoane Wissa in action soon, but Howe\\u2019s latest update on the former Brentford striker was not overly optimistic. He said: \\u201cHe\\u2019s on the grass and working but he definitely won\\u2019t be involved on Sunday. I\\u2019d say he\\u2019s not close to training with the group due to fitness. I\\u2019m not trying to be evasive but I don\\u2019t know when the moment will be when he\\u2019s back with the squad.\\u201d Oh dear. Eddie Howe is up next. And the Newcastle manager has been saying what everyone else has been thinking about their weekend opponents, West Ham. The thing I would say from looking at the squad they have got is they have a group of very good players. There is no doubting the quality of the players they have got, especially in attacking areas. Lucas Paquet\\u00e1, Jarrod Bowen, Niclas F\\u00fcllkrug\\u2026 yep West Ham do have some top players. So why have they been so bad this season? They\\u2019ve got four points, and one win, in nine games this term. There\\u2019s been a bit of back-and-forth between Amorim and Sean Dyche \\u2013 largely over comments Dyche made a while back, claiming he \\u201cbet [he] could win more games with that squad playing a 4-4-2,\\u201d amid that ongoing debate about Amorim\\u2019s 3-4-3. \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s true that if we play 4-4-2 we win more games,\\u201d Amorim said. \\u201cBut I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while, but in the future it\\u2019s going to be better. I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and as a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don\\u2019t say very strong things, I don\\u2019t want to watch you. So I understand that it\\u2019s a completely different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.\\u201d Dyche did clarify his comments. The Nottingham Forest boss added: \\u201cClickbait kills everything, it changes the whole story. I\\u2019m sure Man United have got a big enough press department to watch that whole interview, because I equally said managers should be given time.\\u201d Here\\u2019s what Amorim said about his year in the Manchester United hot-seat: It was a journey, a big journey. It was tough, really tough, good moments and bad moments. I learned a lot that is really important. I found out that even in my lower moments I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand. Today the answer is different from three weeks ago. One of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years. It\\u2019s hard to believe it\\u2019s almost been a year since Manchester United appointed Ruben Amorim. After three successive wins of late, including that first victory at Anfield against Liverpool for almost 10 years, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS\\u2019s faith in Amorim suddenly feels farsighted. Rob Draper has dived deeper into the past 12 months at Old Trafford. And in the upcoming posts we\\u2019ll hear what Amorim said in his press conference before United\\u2019s trip to Nottingham Forest tomorrow. West Ham midfielder Lucas Paquet\\u00e1 has been reprimanded and warned as to his future conduct over his failure to co-operate with a Football Association investigation into spot-fixing allegations. Paquet\\u00e1 was cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent commission in July, but the commission did find he had failed to comply with a requirement to answer questions and provide information to the FA\\u2019s investigation. The FA later confirmed it would not appeal against the commission\\u2019s decision to clear the Brazilian of the four spot-fixing charges. PA Media Cheers Yara. There are loads more Premier League press conferences for us to get stuck into this morning \\u2026 My short stint has come to an end but Dominic Booth is here to bring you the latest. Newcastle: More from Howe on the challenge of West Ham, who are winless since 31 August. They have a group of very good players, especially in the attacking areas, we are going to have our work cut out to limit the space for their attacking talent. Our away form has not been strong enough and we want to put that right in this game. And on the possibility of winning back-to-back games: It would be huge for us. It\\u2019s only with back-to-back wins that we are going to propel ourselves. It\\u2019s so tight. There are a lot of teams congested where we are, you are looking for one positive result to try to elevate you. Newcastle: Eddie Howe has given an update on Lewis Hall and the rest of his squad\\u2019s fitness ahead of Sunday\\u2019s trip to West Ham. [Lewis Hall] is very close. He hasn\\u2019t trained with us yet so hopefully he will be training with us today for the first time. We will see how he looks. I think he has worked really hard. He has looked after himself and looks in really good shape. But then we have to reintroduce himself back into the squad at the right time. I don\\u2019t think there is anything new. We are still managing Will Osula\\u2019s ankle problem. We will see how he is today, but apart from that I think we are as we were. FA Cup: A quick turn to tonight\\u2019s meeting between Luton Town and Forest Green Rovers in the FA Cup first round. Both sides will wear kits made by the eco-conscious brand Reflo and to mark the occasion, Reflo says it will plant 1,000 trees for every goal scored at Kenilworth Road, with a minimum of 1,000 trees guaranteed regardless of the result. The initiative is designed to highlight the growing intersection between football and environmental responsibility, particularly among clubs that have made sustainability part of their identity. Forest Green Rovers, long known as the world\\u2019s first fully vegan football club, are celebrating ten years since that milestone this season. Their kits are also certified by the Vegan Society. Luton Town have launched tree-planting schemes of their own as part of their broader push toward greener practices, including plans for an environmentally conscious new stadium at Power Court. On the pitch, two former Premier League players-turned-managers, Jack Wilshere and Robbie Savage, face off in the dugouts with a spot in the second round and a few thousand trees at stake. Liverpool: The defending champions take on Villa this weekend before hosting Real Madrid in the Champions League. Their final game before the November international break will be away to Manchester City. Here is what Slot said on the challenge Villa posses: If you don\\u2019t win the beginning, people say: \\u2018oh maybe they don\\u2019t have the same team as last season\\u2019 and then they start winning and everything is positive again. Where with us, it\\u2019s exactly the opposite. We\\u2019re both on the same points, apart from Arsenal many teams are in and around the same points. It shows how hard the Premier League is. They\\u2019ve done very well in the last six or seven games. And maybe it\\u2019s not a surprise and you could see in the games they lost before the signs that they are a very good team. They decided not to make a habit out of having more chances than the opponent and not win it. Let\\u2019s make sure we don\\u2019t have that habit. The Dutchman also provided some team news: Ryan [Gravenberch] trained with us yesterday. The other two [Curtis Jones and Alexander Isak] not yet. In the end bit of an injury, things can slow down. Let\\u2019s see where the other two are. Ryan trained with us for the first time yesterday, and will train with us today. Then we\\u2019ll make the call to see if he can start or not. The other two are probably 99.9% not in the squad on Saturday. Liverpool: Slot is also asked whether he and the club are in negotiations for a contract extension. This is the last question that I was expecting. My focus is completely on getting Liverpool back to winning ways. That is my first answer and my second answer, contract talks, if they are even there, we never speak about this here. Let us first start to win again, that is my main focus. Liverpool: More from Slot on finding form. The thing that gives me the most confidence is the quality in the players and the chances these players are creating. This will result in the players scoring more goals than we have up until now. We have to address other things. But if I talk about that and speak about them, people tell me I\\u2019m using excuses. So maybe it\\u2019s best that I just say that. There are other positives to go int this week \\u2013 quality of the players first and foremost and the amount of chances we created from open play is enough to compete for the positions we want to compete for. The Liverpool manager Arne Slot was asked whether he feels his squad depth is the reason his side have lost six of their last seven matches. We miss nothing. I\\u2019m happy with the quality of the team. But I\\u2019m also convinced by the strategy and policy we have. What makes it \\u2018the issue\\u2019 \\u2013 not all of them have had a proper pre-season. When three or four are injured, you go down to having 16 players. I am a firm believer in 21 or 22 players are enough. But you have to keep them fit as we did last season. We are struggling to keep them fit this season for in my opinion, obvious reasons. [Alexander Isak] came to us on 1 September. A few others missed out in pre-season. It has been more difficult than last season to keep them more available. When players are not available, it [workload] comes down more to the same players. But no excuses for results. We had to play a lot of away games with only two days in between. That would have been difficult last season, and for any player that has been fit this season through pre-season. But it has not been the case this season. Then you have to manage it. The upcoming week is three games in eight days. It has nothing to do with squad depth, but it has how we have run through the season in terms of injuries, availability every two or three days. Another spine-tingling weekend of football is upon us. Join us as we preview a frightful round of fixtures from the Premier League, FA Cup, Women\\u2019s Super League and more with team news and key press conferences. Arne Slot\\u2019s press conference ahead of Liverpool\\u2019s match against Aston Villa is underway and the defending champions\\u2019 form leaves much to be desired. Will they rise from the grave? Or will Unai Emery\\u2019s men join the list of teams haunting Anfield\\u2019s faithful?\",\"charCount\":\"37532\",\"shouldHideReaderRevenue\":\"false\",\"showAffiliateLinks\":\"false\",\"bylineHtml\":\"  <a href=\\\"profile\\/john-brewin\\\">John Brewin<\\/a> ,  with <a href=\\\"profile\\/barryglendenning\\\">Barry Glendenning<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"profile\\/dominic-booth\\\">Dominic Booth<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"profile\\/yara-el-shaboury\\\">Yara El-Shaboury<\\/a> \",\"showTableOfContents\":\"false\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/sport\",\"pillarName\":\"Sport\"}', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', NULL);

Dickerson, who over 16 years at the news organization has served in a variety of roles, including moderator of Face the Nation and chief political analyst, announced on Instagram that he would leave at the end of the year. The news was also shared during a morning meeting of CBS Evening News staff. “I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me – the work, the audience’s attention and the honor of being a part of the network’s history – and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human,” wrote Dickerson, who has been serving as co-anchor of CBS Evening News. Bari Weiss, the new CBS News editor-in-chief, is expected to revamp the evening news and has been working to find a new anchor. She is interested in Bret Baier, an anchor on the rightwing Fox News, Status reported, although Baier is under contract at Fox for several more years. Dickerson’s planned departure from the network comes after Shari Redstone, the previous owner of CBS’s parent company, Paramount, agreed to a settle a lawsuit with the Trump administration over a 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. While legal experts said the lawsuit had little merit, Redstone needed approval from federal regulators to sell the company to an entertainment company backed by the billionaire Larry Ellison. Some observers and CBS employees saw the move as Redstone in effect bribing Trump and sacrificing journalistic integrity to serve her business interests. Away from the news division, the network also abruptly announced the cancelation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert shortly before Paramount’s takeover by Skydance Media was finalized, prompting widespread criticism. Regulators ultimately approved the deal, and the company’s new CEO, David Ellison, has also faced criticism for hiring a Trump ally as the network’s ombudsman and appointing Weiss, who does not have any broadcast journalism experience and has frequently attacked news organizations like the New York Times, as the editor-in-chief. A longtime 60 Minutes executive producer left the network in April because he said he had lost his journalistic independence. The president and chief executive officer of CBS News resigned in May because she said it had “become clear the company and I do not agree on the path forward”. While Dickerson did not mention concerns about the future of the station in his departure announcement, he was among those who criticized the settlement. “We pride ourselves on our BS detector, so it ought to work on ourselves, too,” Dickerson said on CBS Evening News Plus in July. “When it doesn’t, the stakes are real, a loss of public trust, the spread of misinformation,” he continued. “The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?” Tom Cibrowski, president of CBS News, said that Dickerson “epitomizes the very best of journalism”. One CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said they were saddened, but not surprised, by Dickerson’s departure. “He’s an excellent journalist, good human being, and someone you want in a newsroom,” the staffer said. His exit probably spells the end of the two-anchor format on CBS Evening News, which the network debuted in late January, but has not improved the show’s fortunes.

Videos of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the Liverpool parade car-ramming attack, scenes from wars, shootings, stabbings and car crashes have recently been pushed into children’s feeds, research by Internet Matters, an online safety organisation, has found. As a result, 39% of those who saw distressing content described themselves as very or extremely upset and worried by it. More than two-thirds of children are getting news from social media apps including TikTok and Instagram, but 40% do not follow news-focused accounts and are instead coming across stories through recommendation algorithms. Nearly two-thirds (61%) of those who get news from social media have seen a worrying or upsetting story in the past month. One 14-year-old girl told researchers: “On TikTok you can see stabbings and kidnappings, which are just not nice to see, especially when you are a bit younger, it makes you feel uncomfortable.” Another girl, 17, said: “On Instagram, before videos get taken down, I think there’s quite a lot of stabbing videos or gruesome videos like that. When Liam Payne died [the One Direction star fell from a hotel balcony] there was video of him circulating and I thought it wasn’t very nice. I would have wanted a trigger warning.” Of news that pops up in his feed, a 13-year-old boy said: “You don’t want to see it sometimes and don’t want to think about it.” The survey findings reflect a wider trend in social media use: the proportion of time users spend viewing content posted by their friends is falling on several platforms. Meta said in court filings this April that only 8% of an Instagram user’s time is now spent viewing friend posts, down by over a third since 2023, with algorithmically recommended posts instead increasingly dominating users’ feeds, contributing to the supposed phenomenon of “brain rot”. The vast majority of children (86%) do not know how to reset the explore algorithm on their social accounts, which serves the upsetting material, according to the research which involved a survey and focus groups with more than 1,000 11- to 17-year-olds. “The shift away from established news channels is radically changing how children and young people consume news, and it is having worrying consequences,” said Rachel Huggins, co-chief executive of Internet Matters, which provides advice to parents and is part-supported by tech companies including TikTok. “The algorithmic design of social media platforms is enabling children to see negative and upsetting content [and it is delivering it] to millions of children and young people who are not seeking it out.” Chi Onwurah MP, the Labour chair of the Commons science and technology committee, said the findings reinforced its conclusion that the Online Safety Act “isn’t up to scratch to protect users”. She called for a stronger regime “that discourages the viral spread of misinformation, regulates generative AI and places much-needed standards on to social media companies”. Under the Online Safety Act, codes to protect children require social media companies to give children age-appropriate access to content that depicts or encourages serious violence or injury. Younger children are seeing news relating to war and conflict, and violence and crime, less than older children but Internet Matters said: “It is still concerning that 11- to 12-year-olds are seeing this content at all given many social media platforms have a minimum age of 13+ outlined in their terms of service.” According to TikTok, human blood and extreme physical fighting cannot be included in its “for you” feed and the platform does not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing or extremely violent content. It said it uses independent factcheckers and allows parents to block their teens from using the app during times they control and to filter content. Instagram has been approached for comment. A UK government spokesperson said new child safety requirements under the Online Safety Act meant it expected young people to be protected from harmful content, including violent material, and illegal mis- and disinformation, and this should result in “less toxic feeds”. “We will not hesitate to act where evidence shows further intervention is needed to protect children,” they said.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/16/gruesome-videos-social-media-distressing-news-children-survey', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/72781d6c485a65b7073e63843db561a727836155/569_0_5002_4000/500.jpg', '2025-10-16 16:11:18', '{\"id\":\"society\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/gruesome-videos-social-media-distressing-news-children-survey\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"society\",\"sectionName\":\"Society\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-16T09:11:18Z\",\"webTitle\":\"\\u2018Gruesome videos\\u2019: social media pushes distressing news to children, experts say\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/society\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/gruesome-videos-social-media-distressing-news-children-survey\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/society\\/2025\\/oct\\/16\\/gruesome-videos-social-media-distressing-news-children-survey\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"\\u2018Gruesome videos\\u2019: social media pushes distressing news to children, experts say\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Survey by Internet Matters finds children being left worried and upset by content showing shootings, stabbings and war<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Survey by Internet Matters finds children being left worried and upset by content showing shootings, stabbings and war\",\"byline\":\"Robert Booth Technology editor\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"72781d6c485a65b7073e63843db561a727836155\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/72781d6c485a65b7073e63843db561a727836155\\/569_0_5002_4000\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Two children on their mobile phones under the bedsheet \\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">An online safety organisation has found children have been worried by seeing war, violence and death in news stories on their feeds.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: lakshmiprasad S\\/Alamy<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>More than half of children who get news from social media are left worried and upset after seeing content that involves war, violence and death, according to new research that found social media companies are \\u201cpushing\\u201d distressing news to children who are not seeking it.<\\/p> <p>Videos of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the Liverpool parade car-ramming attack, scenes from wars, shootings, stabbings and car crashes have recently been pushed into children\\u2019s feeds, research by Internet Matters, an online safety organisation, has found.

Instances cited include describing global heating as “the climate scam” and suggesting the government was going to introduce “enforced veganism”. Ofcom has received 1,221 complaints related to the climate crisis since January 2020, when its searchable database began. None resulted in a ruling that the broadcasting code had been breached. In fact, only two such breaches have been found since 2007. More than 50 of the complaints were made by the campaign group Reliable Media about GB News programmes since March 2024. The group said the segments included false statements about climate breakdown that had either gone unchallenged or had failed to be balanced. Ofcom assessed but did not pursue any of the complaints. The campaigners accused Ofcom of “effectively suspending its accuracy rules on this life-and-death issue”. In contrast, the French regulator Arcom has found four broadcasting code breaches related to the climate crisis in the last two years. In one, the rightwing channel CNews was fined €20,000 (£17,000) for a segment in which a speaker said climate change was “a lie, a scam”. GB News said the campaigners were politically motivated and wanted to shut down public debate. The Guardian reviewed a sample of 18 of the complaints made by Reliable Media. They included the GB News host Ben Leo describing global heating as “the climate scam” in April 2025 and a guest on a September 2024 show hosted by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, criticising those “who say ‘Oh global warming, global warming, global warming’ as though this were a problem. You just go outside tonight, you’ll see it isn’t really”. In November 2024, the GB News host Leo Kearse misleadingly suggested that the UK government was going to introduce “enforced veganism”. A regular contributor to the Headliners show, Lewis Schaffer, claimed in July 2024 that “climate change is rubbish” and that “climate is the full-on war” as opposed to a “culture war”. A few weeks earlier Schaffer claimed “the truth is climate change is not a real thing” and that “we’ve been lied to”. Another guest said in June 2024 that “since 1979 we’ve been checking the change and comparing it with the forecast of the UN models … and it just doesn’t happen as advertised”. In fact, UN climate models have been remarkably accurate. The burning of fossil fuels has “unequivocally caused global warming”, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC is a collaboration of thousands of leading scientists and its conclusions are signed off by its 195 member countries, including the UK. “Widespread losses and damages to nature and people” will continue to intensify, the IPCC said, and rapid cuts in carbon emissions to net zero are required: “There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.” Ofcom’s broadcasting code requires that factual programmes “must not materially mislead the audience” and that “news, in whatever form, must be reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality”. The code further requires that “alternative viewpoints must be adequately represented” when programme presenters express their own views on matters of political controversy or public policy. Guidance notes for the code add that: “An example of an issue which Ofcom considered to be broadly settled is the scientific principles behind the theory of anthropogenic global warming.” “Obviously we’re all free as individuals to hold whatever opinions we like,” said Richard Wilson, the director of Reliable Media. “But running a TV or radio station [means] you’re promising to uphold some pretty basic standards around truth and accuracy. The problem is that Ofcom is now allowing some TV and radio stations to flout the rules and on an issue like climate change the stakes could not be higher.” Ofcom was “hiding behind a simplistic and distorted definition of freedom of expression”, he said, adding that Arcom’s approach in France showed it was possible for regulators to take robust action on climate misinformation. A spokesperson for Ofcom said: “We enforce our rules fairly and proportionately, acting independently and impartially at all times. In line with the right to freedom of expression, our rules allow for robust debate about topical issues, and broadcasters are free to include controversial opinions in their programmes, providing they comply with the code.” In a response to a freedom of information request, Ofcom said “there have been no recent investigations” relating to climate change. It said the only investigations it held on record were from 2017 and 2007, in which BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4 respectively were judged to have breached the broadcasting code. A GB News spokesperson said: “Like all these politically motivated activist groups the only thing that is ‘reliable’ is their desire to shut down public debate – even when a broadcaster is fully compliant with the rules. Unfortunately for them they are losing. GB News is fearless in its coverage of all perspectives including those which might challenge so-called consensus.” Arcom has declared four breaches of its broadcasting code related to climate change since 2023. As well as fining CNews for the 2023 television segment in which a speaker said climate change was “a lie, a scam” and “a form of totalitarianism”, Sud Radio received warnings after programmes in which “several statements contradicted or minimised the existing scientific consensus on current climate change, in treatment lacking rigour and without contradiction”, which constituted “a failure by the company to fulfil its obligation of honesty”. Arcom’s deputy director, Pauline Combredet-Blassel, said in April: “Since there is a scientific consensus on climate change, we verify whether it is referenced in the disputed segment, and we only intervene if it is not.” Eva Morel, at QuotaClimat, the French campaign group that filed the climate complaints to Arcom, said: “It is perfectly OK to have different opinions on climate change. What becomes problematic is when a society can no longer agree on facts, because facts are the foundation of trust, which in turn underpins law, and ultimately, democracy.” She added: “When the media blur the line between facts and opinions, it doesn’t lead people to trust in alternative truths; it leads them to trust in nothing at all. Sowing doubt about climate science serves to obstruct climate action and it endangers lives.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/25/enforced-veganism-ofcom-gb-news-flout-accuracy-rules-say-climate-campaigners', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/51aa66b1456065c745119e95ce67b5954b7ea954/147_0_2259_1808/500.jpg', '2025-10-25 13:00:27', '{\"id\":\"environment\\/2025\\/oct\\/25\\/enforced-veganism-ofcom-gb-news-flout-accuracy-rules-say-climate-campaigners\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"environment\",\"sectionName\":\"Environment\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-25T06:00:27Z\",\"webTitle\":\"\\u2018Enforced veganism\\u2019: Ofcom lets GB News flout accuracy rules, say climate campaigners\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/environment\\/2025\\/oct\\/25\\/enforced-veganism-ofcom-gb-news-flout-accuracy-rules-say-climate-campaigners\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/environment\\/2025\\/oct\\/25\\/enforced-veganism-ofcom-gb-news-flout-accuracy-rules-say-climate-campaigners\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"\\u2018Enforced veganism\\u2019: Ofcom lets GB News flout accuracy rules, say climate campaigners\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Exclusive: Regulator has received 1,221 complaints about UK broadcasters since 2020 but found no breaches of its code<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Exclusive: Regulator has received 1,221 complaints about UK broadcasters since 2020 but found no breaches of its code\",\"byline\":\"Damian Carrington Environment editor\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"51aa66b1456065c745119e95ce67b5954b7ea954\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/51aa66b1456065c745119e95ce67b5954b7ea954\\/104_0_3341_1808\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"GB news host Leo Kearse \\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"541\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">The GB News host Leo Kearse suggested in November 2024 that the UK government was going to introduce \\u2018enforced veganism\\u2019.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: GB News<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>The UK\\u2019s TV and radio regulator is allowing GB News and others to \\u201cflout\\u201d accuracy rules and broadcast climate change denial, say campaigners.

Instances cited include describing global heating as \\u201cthe climate scam\\u201d and suggesting the government was going to introduce \\u201cenforced veganism\\u201d. Ofcom has received 1,221 complaints related to the climate crisis since January 2020, when its searchable database began. None resulted in a ruling that the broadcasting code had been breached. In fact, only two such breaches have been found since 2007. More than 50 of the complaints were made by the campaign group Reliable Media about GB News programmes since March 2024. The group said the segments included false statements about climate breakdown that had either gone unchallenged or had failed to be balanced. Ofcom assessed but did not pursue any of the complaints. The campaigners accused Ofcom of \\u201ceffectively suspending its accuracy rules on this life-and-death issue\\u201d. In contrast, the French regulator Arcom has found four broadcasting code breaches related to the climate crisis in the last two years. In one, the rightwing channel CNews was fined \\u20ac20,000 (\\u00a317,000) for a segment in which a speaker said climate change was \\u201ca lie, a scam\\u201d. GB News said the campaigners were politically motivated and wanted to shut down public debate. The Guardian reviewed a sample of 18 of the complaints made by Reliable Media. They included the GB News host Ben Leo describing global heating as \\u201cthe climate scam\\u201d in April 2025 and a guest on a September 2024 show hosted by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, criticising those \\u201cwho say \\u2018Oh global warming, global warming, global warming\\u2019 as though this were a problem. You just go outside tonight, you\\u2019ll see it isn\\u2019t really\\u201d. In November 2024, the GB News host Leo Kearse misleadingly suggested that the UK government was going to introduce \\u201cenforced veganism\\u201d. A regular contributor to the Headliners show, Lewis Schaffer, claimed in July 2024 that \\u201cclimate change is rubbish\\u201d and that \\u201cclimate is the full-on war\\u201d as opposed to a \\u201cculture war\\u201d. A few weeks earlier Schaffer claimed \\u201cthe truth is climate change is not a real thing\\u201d and that \\u201cwe\\u2019ve been lied to\\u201d. Another guest said in June 2024 that \\u201csince 1979 we\\u2019ve been checking the change and comparing it with the forecast of the UN models \\u2026 and it just doesn\\u2019t happen as advertised\\u201d. In fact, UN climate models have been remarkably accurate. The burning of fossil fuels has \\u201cunequivocally caused global warming\\u201d, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC is a collaboration of thousands of leading scientists and its conclusions are signed off by its 195 member countries, including the UK. \\u201cWidespread losses and damages to nature and people\\u201d will continue to intensify, the IPCC said, and rapid cuts in carbon emissions to net zero are required: \\u201cThere is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.\\u201d Ofcom\\u2019s broadcasting code requires that factual programmes \\u201cmust not materially mislead the audience\\u201d and that \\u201cnews, in whatever form, must be reported with due accuracy and presented with due impartiality\\u201d. The code further requires that \\u201calternative viewpoints must be adequately represented\\u201d when programme presenters express their own views on matters of political controversy or public policy. Guidance notes for the code add that: \\u201cAn example of an issue which Ofcom considered to be broadly settled is the scientific principles behind the theory of anthropogenic global warming.\\u201d \\u201cObviously we\\u2019re all free as individuals to hold whatever opinions we like,\\u201d said Richard Wilson, the director of Reliable Media. \\u201cBut running a TV or radio station [means] you\\u2019re promising to uphold some pretty basic standards around truth and accuracy.

(129, NULL, NULL, 'commentisfree/2025/oct/11/why-is-this-fox-news-host-speculating-about-aocs-sex-life', 'Why is this Fox News host speculating about AOC’s sex life? | Arwa Mahdawi', 'Even his colleague has dubbed Jesse Watters’s claim about Ocasio-Cortez and Stephen Miller ‘creepy’', 'Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and United States homeland security adviser, is one of the most influential people in the Trump administration. He is also such a hate-filled little man that members of his own family are publicly rebuking him. During Donald Trump’s first term, in 2018, Miller’s uncle, Dr David Glosser, wrote a piece for Politico calling Miller an “immigration hypocrite”. Glosser noted that if Miller’s hardline immigration policies “had been in force a century ago, our family [Jewish refugees who fled to the US from Europe to avoid persecution] would have been wiped out”. Then, in July, a woman called Alisa Kasmer, Miller’s cousin and former babysitter, wrote a viral Facebook post calling the Trump aide “the face of evil”. Miller’s cruelty, she said, left her feeling “ashamed and shattered”. While some of his extended family can’t seem to stand him, Miller does have a very enthusiastic cheerleader in the form of the Fox News host Jesse Watters. Last October, Watters claimed that his show’s audience believes that Miller is “some sort of sexual matador” and asked Miller to comment on this. The Maga-dor responded by telling young men to “be the alpha … show that you are not a beta … Be a proud and loud Trump supporter and your dating life will be fantastic.” This is terrible advice for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that gen Z women are the most liberal group in the US. I’m afraid it doesn’t end there; a couple of weeks ago, the Fox News host had Miller’s wife, Katie (a Maga bigwig in her own right), on his show to chat about how sexy Stephen is. “What is it like being married to such a sexual matador?” Watters joked. Very inspiring, apparently; he wakes up every morning excited about how he is going to “defeat the left”. It doesn’t even end there. This week, Watters once again sang his favourite man’s praises on TV, calling Miller a “policy savant”. He added: “Men who are high-value men, like Stephen Miller, take risks. They’re brave, they’re unafraid, they’re confident and they’re on a mission. And they have younger wives with beautiful children.” Watters went on to claim that the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “wants to sleep with Miller … it is so obvious”. The whole spiel was so weird that even Watters’s colleague, Greg Gutfeld, appeared disturbed. “That was pretty creepy,” Gutfeld said. While Watters doesn’t seem to need an excuse to praise Miller, this week’s episode wasn’t entirely unprompted. Rather, Watters was reacting to an Instagram video in which Ocasio-Cortez called Miller a clown and urged people to laugh at Maga. “Miller looks like he is so mad that he is 4’10” that he’s taking that anger out at any other population possible,” AOC said in the video. “Laugh at them! Laugh at them!” It’s not particularly clever to mock someone’s height. (AOC has since said she loves “short kings” and was talking about how “big or small someone is on the inside”.) Nevertheless, the lawmaker is absolutely correct that the way to get under the skin of people in Maga-land is to laugh at them. Ghouls like Trump and Miller don’t care if you call them evil or hypocritical. They don’t care if you use facts and logic against them. What they care about is being laughed at. What they really can’t stand is being mocked. “Humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on fascism, noted last year after Democrats started calling Republicans “weird”. You can see how thin-skinned Maga is by the ridiculous amount of traction that AOC’s throwaway joke has had. Mediaite has reported that three primetime Fox News hosts factchecked Miller’s height: Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Ingraham even had Miller on her show and played the clip to him while he squirmed in discomfort. “What a train wreck, what a train wreck … that lady is a walking nightmare,” Miller replied. He also clarified that he is 5’10”. A very big boy. Steven Cheung, who is White House director of communications, also responded to Ocasio-Cortez’s comments with a post on his official Twitter account saying: “Sounds like @AOC is often used to the shorter things in life.” He added a pinching hand emoji, which is sometimes used to suggest a small penis. The Trump administration should not be underestimated by any means. They are organized, they are ruthless, and they are proving extremely effective at implementing their agenda. But while we shouldn’t underestimate Trumpers, it’s helpful to remember that they’re not invincible. AOC is right: we should laugh at them. It’s either laugh or cry. French appeals court increases sentence of Gisèle Pelicot rapist Husamettin Dogan contested his first conviction, telling the court Pelicot’s husband had invited him over so it was OK. The court found otherwise this week, increasing Dogan’s prison sentence to 10 years. Pelicot’s lawyer had told the court: “[C]onsent is personal, not delegated. Consent is obtained directly and not by proxy from a husband.” Women may carry a higher genetic risk of depression New research published in Nature Communications has found 16 genetic variants linked to depression in women, compared with eight in men. Latvia may withdraw from international domestic violence treaty Women’s rights activists protested outside the Latvian parliament this week following a decision by lawmakers last month to start a process that could lead to withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention, which aims to standardize support for women who are victims of violence and to promote gender equality. Almost 55,000 preschool children in Gaza are acutely malnourished That’s according to a new study published in the Lancet, which shows a clear link between Israel’s aid blockade and malnutrition. Even if a ceasefire holds and adequate food is allowed into the strip, these kids will probably have serious poor long-term outcomes from being starved in their critical years. It is hard to defend deliberately starving babies – which is why Israel is spending hundreds of millions on propaganda efforts including, according to Drop Site News, $45m on a Google advertising campaign promoting Israeli government talking points. UK universities offered to spy on students on behalf of weapons companies According to emails obtained by the Guardian and Liberty Investigates, a number of UK universities reassured arms companies worried about campus protests that they would monitor students’ social media accounts. Per the Guardian, one university “appeared to agree to a request from Raytheon UK, the British wing of a major US defence contractor, to ‘monitor university chat groups’ before a campus visit”.

He is also such a hate-filled little man that members of his own family are publicly rebuking him. During Donald Trump\\u2019s first term, in 2018, Miller\\u2019s uncle, Dr David Glosser, wrote a piece for Politico calling Miller an \\u201cimmigration hypocrite\\u201d. Glosser noted that if Miller\\u2019s hardline immigration policies \\u201chad been in force a century ago, our family [Jewish refugees who fled to the US from Europe to avoid persecution] would have been wiped out\\u201d. Then, in July, a woman called Alisa Kasmer, Miller\\u2019s cousin and former babysitter, wrote a viral Facebook post calling the Trump aide \\u201cthe face of evil\\u201d. Miller\\u2019s cruelty, she said, left her feeling \\u201cashamed and shattered\\u201d. While some of his extended family can\\u2019t seem to stand him, Miller does have a very enthusiastic cheerleader in the form of the Fox News host Jesse Watters. Last October, Watters claimed that his show\\u2019s audience believes that Miller is \\u201csome sort of sexual matador\\u201d and asked Miller to comment on this. The Maga-dor responded by telling young men to \\u201cbe the alpha \\u2026 show that you are not a beta \\u2026 Be a proud and loud Trump supporter and your dating life will be fantastic.\\u201d This is terrible advice for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that gen Z women are the most liberal group in the US. I\\u2019m afraid it doesn\\u2019t end there; a couple of weeks ago, the Fox News host had Miller\\u2019s wife, Katie (a Maga bigwig in her own right), on his show to chat about how sexy Stephen is. \\u201cWhat is it like being married to such a sexual matador?\\u201d Watters joked. Very inspiring, apparently; he wakes up every morning excited about how he is going to \\u201cdefeat the left\\u201d. It doesn\\u2019t even end there. This week, Watters once again sang his favourite man\\u2019s praises on TV, calling Miller a \\u201cpolicy savant\\u201d. He added: \\u201cMen who are high-value men, like Stephen Miller, take risks. They\\u2019re brave, they\\u2019re unafraid, they\\u2019re confident and they\\u2019re on a mission. And they have younger wives with beautiful children.\\u201d Watters went on to claim that the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \\u201cwants to sleep with Miller \\u2026 it is so obvious\\u201d. The whole spiel was so weird that even Watters\\u2019s colleague, Greg Gutfeld, appeared disturbed. \\u201cThat was pretty creepy,\\u201d Gutfeld said. While Watters doesn\\u2019t seem to need an excuse to praise Miller, this week\\u2019s episode wasn\\u2019t entirely unprompted. Rather, Watters was reacting to an Instagram video in which Ocasio-Cortez called Miller a clown and urged people to laugh at Maga. \\u201cMiller looks like he is so mad that he is 4\\u201910\\u201d that he\\u2019s taking that anger out at any other population possible,\\u201d AOC said in the video. \\u201cLaugh at them! Laugh at them!\\u201d It\\u2019s not particularly clever to mock someone\\u2019s height. (AOC has since said she loves \\u201cshort kings\\u201d and was talking about how \\u201cbig or small someone is on the inside\\u201d.) Nevertheless, the lawmaker is absolutely correct that the way to get under the skin of people in Maga-land is to laugh at them. Ghouls like Trump and Miller don\\u2019t care if you call them evil or hypocritical. They don\\u2019t care if you use facts and logic against them. What they care about is being laughed at. What they really can\\u2019t stand is being mocked. \\u201cHumor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics,\\u201d Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on fascism, noted last year after Democrats started calling Republicans \\u201cweird\\u201d. You can see how thin-skinned Maga is by the ridiculous amount of traction that AOC\\u2019s throwaway joke has had. Mediaite has reported that three primetime Fox News hosts factchecked Miller\\u2019s height: Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Ingraham even had Miller on her show and played the clip to him while he squirmed in discomfort. \\u201cWhat a train wreck, what a train wreck \\u2026 that lady is a walking nightmare,\\u201d Miller replied. He also clarified that he is 5\\u201910\\u201d. A very big boy. Steven Cheung, who is White House director of communications, also responded to Ocasio-Cortez\\u2019s comments with a post on his official Twitter account saying: \\u201cSounds like @AOC is often used to the shorter things in life.\\u201d He added a pinching hand emoji, which is sometimes used to suggest a small penis.

(130, NULL, NULL, 'media/2025/oct/21/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-jr-business-fox-news', 'Fox News host Laura Ingraham joins business venture with Donald Trump Jr', 'Host often criticized Hunter Biden’s business on her show and said he capitalized on his father’s presidency for deals', 'Fox News host Laura Ingraham is joining a business venture that includes Donald Trump Jr – after she repeatedly criticized the business dealings of another president’s son: Hunter Biden. Ingraham, Trump Jr and Chamath Palihapitiya, a business associate of Donald Trump’s eldest son and namesake, were all listed as board members of a new venture seeking to go public on the stock market, according to Bloomberg. It purports to “fund the next chapter of American Exceptionalism and help Make America Grow Again”. A filing for the company, Colombier Acquisition Corp III, has designated it as a special-purpose acquisition company, or Spac, which is a shell company that raises money on the stock market before merging with an existing company that isn’t on the market yet. The company is looking to raise $260m in its initial public offering (IPO). The announcement emphasizes the growing coziness between Fox and the Trump family. In February, Fox launched a weekend show featuring Lara Trump, Trump’s daughter-in-law who joined the network as a contributor in 2021. While the network, during Joe Biden’s Oval Office term, had appeared to grow cold toward Trump, it has fully embraced his second presidency. Ingraham, a longtime star of the network, was a vocal critic of Hunter Biden and his business dealings while his father was vice-president under Barack Obama. She argued that Biden utilized his dad’s political influence to carry out business deals. Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group, estimated that Ingraham mentioned Hunter Biden in more than 150 episodes of her show in 2023 and 2024, in the second half of his father’s presidency. Last December, when Joe Biden pardoned his son, a move that was seen as controversial among liberals and conservatives, Ingraham compared the family to the Corleone mob family of the fictional Godfather movie franchise. “Given what we’ve learned about the long-term corruption and deception of the Biden family, the Corleones have nothing on them,” Ingraham said. Joe Biden had previously said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son. But, upon pardoning him, the then president said his son had become a political target. In addition to controversial links to foreign companies while his father was vice-president, Hunter Biden was also found guilty of felony charges related to a handgun purchase in 2018 and federal taxes. Last November, after his father won the election, Trump Jr announced his new role at 1789 Capital, an investment firm with close ties to conservative donors. The company’s website says that it funds “the next chapter of American exceptionalism”. So far, it has invested in companies in AI, energy, defense and three of billionaire Elon Musk’s companies. In September, the firm quietly passed $1bn in assets, according to Reuters. The company, in a statement to Reuters, said that it “maximizes transparency and compliance, even though no one at the fund has ever worked in government”. The White House, meanwhile, has insisted that Trump and his family have never engaged in conflicts of interest. Trump and his eldest sons were found guilty of civil fraud in 2024. In August, an appeals court threw out the $355m penalty a New York judge ordered Trump to pay after he was deemed guilty of fraud in his real estate business, though the appeals court affirmed the overall fraud verdict.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/21/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-jr-business-fox-news', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/67bd2b9b099a622323b55bbde0008aaf5ebcfb20/0_0_3000_2400/500.jpg', '2025-10-21 20:54:21', '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/oct\\/21\\/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-jr-business-fox-news\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-21T13:54:21Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Fox News host Laura Ingraham joins business venture with Donald Trump Jr\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/21\\/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-jr-business-fox-news\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/21\\/laura-ingraham-donald-trump-jr-business-fox-news\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Fox News host Laura Ingraham joins business venture with Donald Trump Jr\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Host often criticized Hunter Biden\\u2019s business on her show and said he capitalized on his father\\u2019s presidency for deals<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Host often criticized Hunter Biden\\u2019s business on her show and said he capitalized on his father\\u2019s presidency for deals\",\"byline\":\"Lauren Aratani\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"67bd2b9b099a622323b55bbde0008aaf5ebcfb20\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/67bd2b9b099a622323b55bbde0008aaf5ebcfb20\\/0_0_3000_2400\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"a composite image showing a woman in pink dress and a man in grey suit\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Laura Ingraham is going into business with Donald Trump Jr.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Composite: Getty Images, Reuters<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/fox-news\\\">Fox News<\\/a> host Laura Ingraham is joining a business venture that includes <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/donald-trump-jr\\\">Donald Trump Jr<\\/a> \\u2013 after she repeatedly criticized the business dealings of another president\\u2019s son: Hunter Biden.<\\/p> <p>Ingraham, Trump Jr and Chamath Palihapitiya, a business associate of Donald Trump\\u2019s eldest son and namesake, were all listed as board members of a new venture seeking to go public on the stock market, according to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.bloomberg.com\\/news\\/articles\\/2025-10-17\\/trump-jr-s-firm-taps-palihapitya-gop-influencers-for-new-spac\\\">Bloomberg<\\/a>.

Ingraham, Trump Jr and Chamath Palihapitiya, a business associate of Donald Trump\\u2019s eldest son and namesake, were all listed as board members of a new venture seeking to go public on the stock market, according to Bloomberg. It purports to \\u201cfund the next chapter of American Exceptionalism and help Make America Grow Again\\u201d. A filing for the company, Colombier Acquisition Corp III, has designated it as a special-purpose acquisition company, or Spac, which is a shell company that raises money on the stock market before merging with an existing company that isn\\u2019t on the market yet. The company is looking to raise $260m in its initial public offering (IPO). The announcement emphasizes the growing coziness between Fox and the Trump family. In February, Fox launched a weekend show featuring Lara Trump, Trump\\u2019s daughter-in-law who joined the network as a contributor in 2021. While the network, during Joe Biden\\u2019s Oval Office term, had appeared to grow cold toward Trump, it has fully embraced his second presidency. Ingraham, a longtime star of the network, was a vocal critic of Hunter Biden and his business dealings while his father was vice-president under Barack Obama. She argued that Biden utilized his dad\\u2019s political influence to carry out business deals. Media Matters, a liberal media watchdog group, estimated that Ingraham mentioned Hunter Biden in more than 150 episodes of her show in 2023 and 2024, in the second half of his father\\u2019s presidency. Last December, when Joe Biden pardoned his son, a move that was seen as controversial among liberals and conservatives, Ingraham compared the family to the Corleone mob family of the fictional Godfather movie franchise. \\u201cGiven what we\\u2019ve learned about the long-term corruption and deception of the Biden family, the Corleones have nothing on them,\\u201d Ingraham said. Joe Biden had previously said he would not use his executive authority to pardon his son. But, upon pardoning him, the then president said his son had become a political target. In addition to controversial links to foreign companies while his father was vice-president, Hunter Biden was also found guilty of felony charges related to a handgun purchase in 2018 and federal taxes. Last November, after his father won the election, Trump Jr announced his new role at 1789 Capital, an investment firm with close ties to conservative donors. The company\\u2019s website says that it funds \\u201cthe next chapter of American exceptionalism\\u201d. So far, it has invested in companies in AI, energy, defense and three of billionaire Elon Musk\\u2019s companies. In September, the firm quietly passed $1bn in assets, according to Reuters. The company, in a statement to Reuters, said that it \\u201cmaximizes transparency and compliance, even though no one at the fund has ever worked in government\\u201d. The White House, meanwhile, has insisted that Trump and his family have never engaged in conflicts of interest. Trump and his eldest sons were found guilty of civil fraud in 2024. In August, an appeals court threw out the $355m penalty a New York judge ordered Trump to pay after he was deemed guilty of fraud in his real estate business, though the appeals court affirmed the overall fraud verdict.\",\"charCount\":\"3384\",\"shouldHideReaderRevenue\":\"false\",\"showAffiliateLinks\":\"false\",\"bylineHtml\":\"<a href=\\\"profile\\/lauren-aratani\\\">Lauren Aratani<\\/a>\",\"showTableOfContents\":\"false\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', NULL);

(131, NULL, NULL, 'us-news/2025/oct/31/radio-free-asia-suspends-news-operations-amid-cuts-us-government-shutdown', 'Radio Free Asia suspends news operations amid cuts and US government shutdown', 'RFA will begin closing overseas bureaus, as well as laying off and paying severance to staff members, with the hope that it could return in the future', 'Radio Free Asia (RFA) has said it is suspending its news operations due to the US government shutdown and the Trump administration’s cuts to government-funded news services. “RFA has been forced to suspend all remaining news content production – for the first time in its 29 years of existence,” said Bay Fang, RFA’s president and CEO, in a statement. “In an effort to conserve limited resources on hand and preserve the possibility of restarting operations should consistent funding become available, RFA is taking further steps to responsibly shrink its already reduced footprint,” she said. RFA was founded nearly three decades ago to report on China and other Asian countries without independent media. It has been operating with a skeleton staff the past few months, primarily producing a few stories online as the administration sought to choke off its funding. Donald Trump’s team has contended that operations like RFA, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Voice of America are poorly run and a waste of government resources. Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, RFA’s closure comes after the US president met Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a trip to Asia. Radio Free Asia will begin shutting down overseas bureaus, laying off and paying severance to staff members, most of whom have been on unpaid leave since last March, Fang said, leaving open the possibility that the organisation could restart operations in the future. “However drastic these measures may seem, they position RFA, a private corporation, for a future in which it would be possible to scale up and resume providing accurate, uncensored news for people living in some of the world’s most closed places,” Fang said. With its own journalists and contractors in Asia, RFA has reported aggressively on stories some governments don’t want to see – the repression of Uyghurs in China, the aftermath of the 2021 military coup in Myanmar and the plight of defectors in North Korea. The outlet had been growing; visitors to its website increased 20% between 2023 and 2024. Shutting the broadcaster, which produced news in multiple Asian languages, “is a gift to dictators like Xi Jinping” especially “at a time when Beijing has worked quite assiduously to control what stories can and can’t get told the country”, said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China under president Joe Biden, wrote on X that shuttering RFA was a “major mistake” that “will prevent us from telling the truth to the Chinese people and countering Beijing’s propaganda.” RFE/Radio Liberty, similar to RFA as a private corporation funded by the government, said its own news services were staying up, “and we plan to continue reaching our audiences for the foreseeable future”, the organisation said this week. It operates in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Middle East. The service had launched its own lawsuit against the administration. RFE/Radio Liberty says it received its last federal funding in September. It is operating on reserves, and has taken cost-cutting steps like cutting contracts with freelancers, reducing programming and placing some staff members on partially paid leave. It was not immediately clear why the two organisations are taking different approaches. While having the same governing and funding structure, RFA and RFE/Radio Liberty are headquartered in North America and Europe respectively, and are governed under different labour laws. Voice of America, which has concentrated on providing news about the United States to audiences in other countries, had been operating on a very limited basis since its funding was cut off and has essentially stopped due to the government shutdown. Some employees have sued to block the administration’s plans.

Coincidence?, 3:D - The portrait was completed in July 1943 and was only displayed a handful of times before it disappeared into a private collection. The Thursday quiz can recommend the new Picasso exhibition at Tate Modern in London, 4:B - Trainy McTrainface didn\'t get a look in, 5:A - Every good train nerd knows that the pub was built 200 years ago at the end of the Yarm branch of the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, 6:A - Emil had to be moved after occupying one of the country\'s busiest railway lines, halting traffic for four hours, and appeared ready to something similar on an autobahn, 7:A - Dr Hugo Lassauce recorded the (ahem) \'saucy\' event. You see what we did there, right?, 8:B - The bigger question here is why someone who earns a reported \\u00a34.25m a year insists their 75-year-old father still needs to go out to work at 2am every night, 9:A - Not perhaps the most inspiring of titles, to be honest, 10:C - It was indeed Austria\'s capital, which needed to get this out of the way so it is free to host the 70th edition of Eurovision next year, 11:D - The artist, whose real name was Keith McIvor, had been diagnosed with an untreatable brain tumour, which he announced in July. His partner in Optimo was Jonnie Wilkes, 12:D - To be honest, the quiz has made a light-hearted question out of it here, but it sounds like it has been a nightmare for Bailey and several other animals inside the Northern Ireland prison system, 13:B - He recorded a time of just under three hours. Well done that man!, 14:A - So slightly over the duration of two Liz Truss premierships, 15:B - The company, which commissioned the display, said it was \'out of line with Arc\\u2019teryx\\u2019s values\'<\\/p>\\n    <h3 class=\\\"quiz__scores-title\\\">Scores<\\/h3>\\n    <ol class=\\\"quiz__scores\\\" data-result-groups-length=\\\"1\\\">\\n     <li class=\\\"quiz__score score\\\" data-title=\\\"We hope you had fun \\u2013 let us know how you got on in the comments\\\" data-share=\\\"I got _\\/_ in the Guardian Thursday news quiz\\\" data-min-score=\\\"0\\\"><p class=\\\"score__min-score\\\">0 and above.<\\/p><p class=\\\"score__title\\\">We hope you had fun \\u2013 let us know how you got on in the comments<\\/p><\\/li>\\n    <\\/ol>\\n   <\\/div> \\n  <\\/div>\\n <\\/gu-atom> \\n<\\/figure> \\n<p><em>If you really do think there has been an egregious error in one of the questions or answers \\u2013 and can show your working and are absolutely 100% positive you aren\\u2019t attempting to factcheck a joke \\u2013 you can complain about it in the comments below.

The same cannot be said for US airports. Donald Trump’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said flights are being reduced to maintain air traffic control safety during the federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between Republicans and Democrats to end the federal budget standoff. Airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where the FAA says air traffic must be reduced by 4% by 6am ET on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports. Trump’s transportation chief, Sean Duffy, wrote on X Thursday that the decision was “not about politics” but rather “about assessing the data and alleviating building risk in the system as controllers continue working without pay”. “It’s safe to fly today, tomorrow, and the day after because of the proactive actions we are taking,” Duffy added. US airlines cancel flights after federal directive to cut air traffic Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the US – including Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Dallas/Fort Worth, Orlando, Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be be affected. All three airports serving the Washington DC area – Washington Dulles international, Baltimore/Washington international and Ronald Reagan Washington national – will be affected, inevitably causing delays and cancellations for lawmakers as well as other travelers. Read the full story US supreme court allows Trump to block passport sex markers for trans and non-binary people The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity. The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. The court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson calling the decision a “pointless but painful perversion”. Read the full story US judge orders Trump administration to fully fund Snap benefits in November The ruling by US district judge John J McConnell Jr on Thursday was in response to a challenge from cities and non-profits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit. The government said it will rely on $4.65bn on emergency funding. “The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund Snap,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial Snap payments and failed to consider the harms individual who rely on those benefits would suffer.” Read the full story Workers decry Trump officials as ‘out of control’ as longest shutdown drags on As the US federal shutdown enters its second month, government workers are accusing the Trump administration of being “out of control” and bullying people who are “simply trying to do their best”. About 700,000 federal employees are furloughed without pay, and about 700,000 additional federal workers have been working without pay through the shutdown. Affected workers say the shutdown has been a continuation of attacks they have experienced under the Trump administration, from mass firings – many of which have been overturned or blocked in federal courts – to drastic budget cuts, pushes to take early retirements or resignation buyouts and threats of withholding back pay for workers furloughed during the shutdown. Read the full story Nancy Pelosi, a force on Capitol Hill for decades, to retire from Congress The California Democratic representative and the first woman to serve as speaker, announced on Thursday she will retire from Congress, two years after stepping down from House leadership. Even when no longer in leadership, the 85-year-old remained enormously influential among Democrats, quietly counseling her party as they navigate Trump’s second term. In 2024, she played a key role in pushing Biden to withdraw from the presidential race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Read the full story Trump announces plan to cut cost of weight loss drugs and expand access The agreement will make oral versions of GLP-1s, which aren’t yet to market but are expected to be approved in the coming months, available at $150 per month for starting doses. The average price for these injectables will be about $350, which will “trend down” to $245 a month over the next two years, the Trump administration said. Trump calls the medications the “fat drug”, his term for these semaglutide or tirzepatide shots, known by their brand names: Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Read the full story Senate blocks Democrats’ bid to check Trump power over Venezuela strikes The 49-51 vote against passing the resolution, mostly along party lines, came a month after a previous effort to stop strikes against alleged drug trafficking boats in international waters similarly failed, 48-51. The new resolution narrowed its scope to attract Republicans, but senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski remained the only two Republicans to cross party lines to support the resolution. Susan Collins and Thom Tillis, who had expressed reservations about the strikes, voted against. Read the full story What else happened today: Here’s the list of US airports cutting flights on Friday due to federal government shutdown. A former Department of Justice employee who threw a sandwich at a federal agent during Donald Trump’s law enforcement surge in Washington DC was found not guilty of assault by a DC jury on Thursday in the latest legal rebuke of the federal intervention. Some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s big electoral wins as evidence they should hold the line and extract as much as possible from Republicans before agreeing to end the longest government shutdown in history. Democrats praised Nancy Pelosi as a “heroic, trailblazing” member of the US House of Representatives, an “icon” and the “greatest speaker in American history”, following her announcement that after 20 terms in Congress she plans to retire. Kevin Roberts, the leader of the conservative thinktank behind Project 2025, has apologized for backing Tucker Carlson’s interview with Hitler fan Nick Fuentes, but is resisting calls to resign.

(136, NULL, NULL, 'commentisfree/2025/oct/12/bari-weisss-cbs-news-50-years-in-the-making', 'Bari Weiss’s ascent at CBS News was 50 years in the making | David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher', 'A half-century ago, CBS’s own president was boasting of his support for an antidemocratic political project. Our new book uses never-before-reported documents to tell the story of a scheme to undermine accountability journalism', 'If you only just started paying attention to the inner workings of the media industry, you might think America’s information environment transformed overnight. In the past few months, a president extracted settlements from media giants as his apparatchiks vowed state retribution against his opponents – all as they defunded public media at a time when the president’s biggest boosters own the algorithms that decide what information is amplified and suppressed. Meanwhile, media companies are merging into ever-larger behemoths, some have muzzled White House critics as their companies seek presidential favors, and the White House is reportedly brokering a deal to hand yet another social media platform over to his billionaire allies. And now, a media industry billionaire has placed CBS News under the control of the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss, who is empowered to shroud her culture war and oligarch-friendly economics in what she calls “journalism that is fair, fearless, and factual”. But as abrupt as this Orwellian turn may seem, it is no sudden pivot – it is instead the culmination of a scheme launched a half-century ago by some of America’s most influential power brokers, as our new book Master Plan exposes. Sketched out in never-before-reported documents, this plot aimed to destroy accountability journalism and make news outlets into champions rather than adversaries of power. If that seems like exaggeration, consider that almost exactly 50 years before Weiss’s appointment, CBS’s own president was boasting of his support for a conservative, antidemocratic political project and bragging about his efforts to shift his news division’s media coverage away from scrutinizing corporate power. It was a harbinger of what was to come. ‘The national television networks should be monitored’ This untold story of American media began in the news business’s Watergate-era transition. In the first half of the 20th century, journalism had swung between the triumphs of investigative reporting and the excesses of Citizen Kane-like oligarchs wielding their media properties as political weapons. But by the early 1970s, the pendulum was swinging back toward the muckrakers – journalism had once again become a problem for the ruling class, exposing national security and corporate scandals – and giving a platform to advocates like Ralph Nader who were holding power accountable. Irate about Nader and other troublemakers, a prominent tobacco industry attorney named Lewis Powell penned a 1971 call to arms for the nation’s largest lobbying group, the Chamber of Commerce, and its corporate members. He noted that “most of the media, including the national TV systems, are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations which depend upon profits, and the enterprise system to survive” – and that therefore they should start deliberately amplifying defenders of the status quo, and stop providing platforms to critics of big business. “Much of the media – for varying motives and in varying degrees – either voluntarily accords unique publicity to these ‘attackers’, or at least allows them to exploit the media for their purposes,” Powell wrote. “The national television networks should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance. This applies not merely to so-called educational programs, but to the daily news analysis, which so often includes the most insidious type of criticism of the enterprise system. Whether this criticism results from hostility or economic ignorance, the result is the gradual erosion of confidence in business and free enterprise.” In this now-infamous Powell memo, he implored corporations to bring their grievances to the Federal Communications Commission, which could threaten to take action against media outlets refusing to toe the corporate line (sound familiar?). And he decried what he depicted as corporate critics’ dangerous infiltration of media conglomerates. “As these bright young men from campuses across the country seek opportunities to change a system which they have been taught to distrust – if not, indeed ‘despise’ – they seek employment in the centers of the real power and influence in our country, namely: with the news media, especially television,” he wrote. Just a few months after Powell penned his memo, then president Richard Nixon nominated him to the US supreme court, where he would engineer rulings equating money to constitutionally protected speech, extend those constitutional protections to corporations aiming to buy elections, and defang antitrust law. After Powell was first confirmed by the Senate, CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite emceed his sendoff party. As Philip Morris executives gave Powell judicial robes emblazoned with tobacco logos, Cronkite narrated a faux radio drama valorizing Powell’s life – all of which was recorded on a vinyl record that we discovered. The event signaled how closely involved the media establishment would soon become in Powell’s conservative political project. ‘Correct the situation at CBS News’ Powell’s memo prompted the Chamber of Commerce to create a taskforce to implement its directives for corporations to begin spending heavily on politics, advertising and thinktanks, building what we now know as the modern conservative movement. Rather than deploying journalists to expose that new master plan, some of the nation’s largest media outlets and their sponsors joined it. According to a document obtained by the Lever, members of this taskforce included CBS vice-president Richard Jencks, ABC executive James Hagerty, newspaper magnate Edward Scripps II, Metromedia executive Mark Evans, Ad Council chair Barton Cummings and Hill &amp; Knowlton president James Cassidy. In correspondence with a local media president enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo, CBS’s then president, Arthur Taylor, wrote that he was actively pressuring CBS News journalists to make their coverage more pro-business. “[The memo] makes good reading, and it is in accord with my own thinking that our free enterprise system is indeed in danger, not only due to the misunderstanding in academic circles, but I might also add the misunderstanding in media circles,” Taylor wrote of the Powell memo. “I’ve been attempting as persuasively as possible for the last year to correct the situation at CBS News with some results, but I’m afraid it’s going to take a long time.” Taylor then added: “I hope we can have an opportunity to discuss methods by which we might accelerate what is obviously a very important movement.” Forwarding Taylor’s letter to a conservative activist, the local media executive wrote that “Taylor has achieved some results and, hopefully, we can help him and others in his position, accomplish more”. Around this time, in 1973, the future Fox News impresario Roger Ailes delivered a presentation to a meeting of business leaders enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo. A college president in attendance wrote that “Ailes outlined the power which advertisers would be able to exert upon TV programming if they were moved to do so” in support of their political goals – and he said that members of the Chamber of Commerce should hire Ailes and focus on “where and how they can apply leverage and be given the tools to exert the leverage”. The following year, Ailes landed a job running TVN, a Fox News forerunner controlled by Joseph Coors, the conservative beer magnate who said he had been “stirred” into political philanthropy by the Powell memo. Like Weiss today, Ailes had no experience running a television newsroom – which apparently made him an attractive candidate to lead a political project masquerading as journalism. “The Coors people trust Ailes because of his affiliation with Republicans – and because he’s not a newsman,” one TVN staffer said at the time. “They don’t trust newsmen.” ‘Media monopoly and autocracy do go hand in hand’ In 1974, the Chamber of Commerce convened a secret meeting to review all the ways the Powell memo acolytes were leveraging media to build the conservative movement. According to the meeting minutes obtained by the Lever, the chamber’s members were: Creating a “new motion picture [that] is being seen by tens of thousands” – which led to a film starring Jimmy Stewart promoting free-market capitalism; Producing “a series of television shows to present business views on vital issues” that would be “for use on the Public Broadcasting network and elsewhere”; Publishing “a FAIR media handbook – particularly to help those in business communicate with press, radio, and television. It describes how business can generate fair, accurate, and informed reporting”; Promoting “a weekly column – discussing timely topics [that] goes to more than 500 press and 300 radio and television outlets”; Writing “monthly editorials – for print and electronic media – used by 70 television, 225 radio stations, plus 300 newspapers”; Distributing “radio voice actualities and television news clips – for major networks and news services”. Meanwhile, the Powell memo taskforce member Barton Cummings used his Ad Council position to launch a nationwide government-sponsored advertising campaign in partnership with then president Gerald Ford’s administration and major corporations to defend free-market capitalism against its critics. All of these efforts were the seeds of what was to come. As the conservative movement built its political power, its champion, Ronald Reagan, soon killed the fairness doctrine that had required time for contrasting political content – a move that birthed the rightwing talk radio monopoly. When the Democrats regained power, Bill Clinton joined in by signing legislation deregulating the media industry so that a handful of megacorporations (and now tech companies) could buy up and control most of what we read, see and hear from news media. George W Bush’s administration then further loosened local media ownership rules, allowing for even more consolidation. At key moments along the way, media conglomerates backed down amid corporate pressure, avoided stories that Wall Street wanted hidden and parroted government lies. And with media industry consolidation and mass layoffs of local journalists, oligarchs and government leaders could more easily narrow the political discourse, knowing that dissenting viewpoints would be shadowbanned or simply shut out – and have nowhere to make inconvenient reporting heard. Of course, every now and then, the sound of protest managed to slip through the matrix. For example, just after Clinton signed the bill accelerating media mergers, Saturday Night Live writers managed to slip this Schoolhouse Rock spoof about media consolidation on to the national television airwaves. It was promptly erased from all future reruns. In the Trump era, there is no longer any attempt to obscure what’s really going on. Nine years ago, as Trump was starting his authoritarian ascent and bashing journalists, CBS’s CEO didn’t sound an alarm – he instead seemed thrilled, declaring that the circus-like environment “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS”. Critics such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were once mercilessly ridiculed for suggesting that billionaire owners politically influence their media properties – but today that influence is on display for all to see. Few even bother to pretend that all the media industry mergers, defunding, purges and surrenders have nothing to do with oligarchs’ self-serving ideological project. Quite the opposite – if you read between the lines, it’s almost as if they are bragging about their role in the movement Powell ignited. Indeed, Weiss’s own Substack – which was reportedly sold to CBS’s parent company for $150m – just published an essay from a former News Corporation executive and e-cigarette company executive effusively valorizing Powell. In that Free Press hagiography, Powell is presented not as a zealot who published an ideological manifesto and sculpted radical precedents legalizing corruption. Instead, he is depicted as “thoughtful, measured, and willing to listen to others” as well as “less partisan and more cautious” than other jurists. That kind of historical revision may land Powell his own bust in Trump’s proposed National Garden of American Heroes – but it will not succeed in obscuring what Powell actually helped create. Everyone can see the transformation of media that he envisioned. It’s right there in our faces – which means we can start calling all of this what it has always been: not merely a crass short-term business play, but a decades-long effort to destroy whatever’s left of the fourth estate that is supposed to deter authoritarianism. “If we don’t break up the anti-free speech media monopolies, we will lose our democracy,” Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut wrote recently. “I wish the billionaires that own these companies cared about democracy more than getting rich. But they don’t. They are willing to help destroy free speech so they can buy a bigger private jet. Media monopoly and autocracy do go hand in hand. And so we need a remedy.” The Lever’s David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher are the authors of the new book Master Plan: The Hidden Plot to Legalize Corruption in America', 'https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/12/bari-weisss-cbs-news-50-years-in-the-making', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ee9ab0eda901e8662797e7b145303b73dab24016/407_0_3889_3111/500.jpg', '2025-10-12 20:00:54', '{\"id\":\"commentisfree\\/2025\\/oct\\/12\\/bari-weisss-cbs-news-50-years-in-the-making\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"commentisfree\",\"sectionName\":\"Opinion\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-12T13:00:54Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Bari Weiss\\u2019s ascent at CBS News was 50 years in the making | David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/commentisfree\\/2025\\/oct\\/12\\/bari-weisss-cbs-news-50-years-in-the-making\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/commentisfree\\/2025\\/oct\\/12\\/bari-weisss-cbs-news-50-years-in-the-making\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Bari Weiss\\u2019s ascent at CBS News was 50 years in the making\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>A half-century ago, CBS\\u2019s own president was boasting of his support for an antidemocratic political project.

In the past few months, a president extracted settlements from media giants as his apparatchiks vowed state retribution against his opponents \\u2013 all as they defunded public media at a time when the president\\u2019s biggest boosters own the algorithms that decide what information is amplified and suppressed. Meanwhile, media companies are merging into ever-larger behemoths, some have muzzled White House critics as their companies seek presidential favors, and the White House is reportedly brokering a deal to hand yet another social media platform over to his billionaire allies. And now, a media industry billionaire has placed CBS News under the control of the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss, who is empowered to shroud her culture war and oligarch-friendly economics in what she calls \\u201cjournalism that is fair, fearless, and factual\\u201d. But as abrupt as this Orwellian turn may seem, it is no sudden pivot \\u2013 it is instead the culmination of a scheme launched a half-century ago by some of America\\u2019s most influential power brokers, as our new book Master Plan exposes. Sketched out in never-before-reported documents, this plot aimed to destroy accountability journalism and make news outlets into champions rather than adversaries of power. If that seems like exaggeration, consider that almost exactly 50 years before Weiss\\u2019s appointment, CBS\\u2019s own president was boasting of his support for a conservative, antidemocratic political project and bragging about his efforts to shift his news division\\u2019s media coverage away from scrutinizing corporate power. It was a harbinger of what was to come. \\u2018The national television networks should be monitored\\u2019 This untold story of American media began in the news business\\u2019s Watergate-era transition. In the first half of the 20th century, journalism had swung between the triumphs of investigative reporting and the excesses of Citizen Kane-like oligarchs wielding their media properties as political weapons. But by the early 1970s, the pendulum was swinging back toward the muckrakers \\u2013 journalism had once again become a problem for the ruling class, exposing national security and corporate scandals \\u2013 and giving a platform to advocates like Ralph Nader who were holding power accountable. Irate about Nader and other troublemakers, a prominent tobacco industry attorney named Lewis Powell penned a 1971 call to arms for the nation\\u2019s largest lobbying group, the Chamber of Commerce, and its corporate members. He noted that \\u201cmost of the media, including the national TV systems, are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations which depend upon profits, and the enterprise system to survive\\u201d \\u2013 and that therefore they should start deliberately amplifying defenders of the status quo, and stop providing platforms to critics of big business. \\u201cMuch of the media \\u2013 for varying motives and in varying degrees \\u2013 either voluntarily accords unique publicity to these \\u2018attackers\\u2019, or at least allows them to exploit the media for their purposes,\\u201d Powell wrote. \\u201cThe national television networks should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance. This applies not merely to so-called educational programs, but to the daily news analysis, which so often includes the most insidious type of criticism of the enterprise system. Whether this criticism results from hostility or economic ignorance, the result is the gradual erosion of confidence in business and free enterprise.\\u201d In this now-infamous Powell memo, he implored corporations to bring their grievances to the Federal Communications Commission, which could threaten to take action against media outlets refusing to toe the corporate line (sound familiar?). And he decried what he depicted as corporate critics\\u2019 dangerous infiltration of media conglomerates. \\u201cAs these bright young men from campuses across the country seek opportunities to change a system which they have been taught to distrust \\u2013 if not, indeed \\u2018despise\\u2019 \\u2013 they seek employment in the centers of the real power and influence in our country, namely: with the news media, especially television,\\u201d he wrote. Just a few months after Powell penned his memo, then president Richard Nixon nominated him to the US supreme court, where he would engineer rulings equating money to constitutionally protected speech, extend those constitutional protections to corporations aiming to buy elections, and defang antitrust law. After Powell was first confirmed by the Senate, CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite emceed his sendoff party. As Philip Morris executives gave Powell judicial robes emblazoned with tobacco logos, Cronkite narrated a faux radio drama valorizing Powell\\u2019s life \\u2013 all of which was recorded on a vinyl record that we discovered. The event signaled how closely involved the media establishment would soon become in Powell\\u2019s conservative political project. \\u2018Correct the situation at CBS News\\u2019 Powell\\u2019s memo prompted the Chamber of Commerce to create a taskforce to implement its directives for corporations to begin spending heavily on politics, advertising and thinktanks, building what we now know as the modern conservative movement. Rather than deploying journalists to expose that new master plan, some of the nation\\u2019s largest media outlets and their sponsors joined it. According to a document obtained by the Lever, members of this taskforce included CBS vice-president Richard Jencks, ABC executive James Hagerty, newspaper magnate Edward Scripps II, Metromedia executive Mark Evans, Ad Council chair Barton Cummings and Hill &amp; Knowlton president James Cassidy. In correspondence with a local media president enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo, CBS\\u2019s then president, Arthur Taylor, wrote that he was actively pressuring CBS News journalists to make their coverage more pro-business. \\u201c[The memo] makes good reading, and it is in accord with my own thinking that our free enterprise system is indeed in danger, not only due to the misunderstanding in academic circles, but I might also add the misunderstanding in media circles,\\u201d Taylor wrote of the Powell memo. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been attempting as persuasively as possible for the last year to correct the situation at CBS News with some results, but I\\u2019m afraid it\\u2019s going to take a long time.\\u201d Taylor then added: \\u201cI hope we can have an opportunity to discuss methods by which we might accelerate what is obviously a very important movement.\\u201d Forwarding Taylor\\u2019s letter to a conservative activist, the local media executive wrote that \\u201cTaylor has achieved some results and, hopefully, we can help him and others in his position, accomplish more\\u201d. Around this time, in 1973, the future Fox News impresario Roger Ailes delivered a presentation to a meeting of business leaders enthusiastic about implementing the Powell memo. A college president in attendance wrote that \\u201cAiles outlined the power which advertisers would be able to exert upon TV programming if they were moved to do so\\u201d in support of their political goals \\u2013 and he said that members of the Chamber of Commerce should hire Ailes and focus on \\u201cwhere and how they can apply leverage and be given the tools to exert the leverage\\u201d. The following year, Ailes landed a job running TVN, a Fox News forerunner controlled by Joseph Coors, the conservative beer magnate who said he had been \\u201cstirred\\u201d into political philanthropy by the Powell memo. Like Weiss today, Ailes had no experience running a television newsroom \\u2013 which apparently made him an attractive candidate to lead a political project masquerading as journalism. \\u201cThe Coors people trust Ailes because of his affiliation with Republicans \\u2013 and because he\\u2019s not a newsman,\\u201d one TVN staffer said at the time. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t trust newsmen.\\u201d \\u2018Media monopoly and autocracy do go hand in hand\\u2019 In 1974, the Chamber of Commerce convened a secret meeting to review all the ways the Powell memo acolytes were leveraging media to build the conservative movement. According to the meeting minutes obtained by the Lever, the chamber\\u2019s members were: Creating a \\u201cnew motion picture [that] is being seen by tens of thousands\\u201d \\u2013 which led to a film starring Jimmy Stewart promoting free-market capitalism; Producing \\u201ca series of television shows to present business views on vital issues\\u201d that would be \\u201cfor use on the Public Broadcasting network and elsewhere\\u201d; Publishing \\u201ca FAIR media handbook \\u2013 particularly to help those in business communicate with press, radio, and television. It describes how business can generate fair, accurate, and informed reporting\\u201d; Promoting \\u201ca weekly column \\u2013 discussing timely topics [that] goes to more than 500 press and 300 radio and television outlets\\u201d; Writing \\u201cmonthly editorials \\u2013 for print and electronic media \\u2013 used by 70 television, 225 radio stations, plus 300 newspapers\\u201d; Distributing \\u201cradio voice actualities and television news clips \\u2013 for major networks and news services\\u201d. Meanwhile, the Powell memo taskforce member Barton Cummings used his Ad Council position to launch a nationwide government-sponsored advertising campaign in partnership with then president Gerald Ford\\u2019s administration and major corporations to defend free-market capitalism against its critics. All of these efforts were the seeds of what was to come. As the conservative movement built its political power, its champion, Ronald Reagan, soon killed the fairness doctrine that had required time for contrasting political content \\u2013 a move that birthed the rightwing talk radio monopoly. When the Democrats regained power, Bill Clinton joined in by signing legislation deregulating the media industry so that a handful of megacorporations (and now tech companies) could buy up and control most of what we read, see and hear from news media. George W Bush\\u2019s administration then further loosened local media ownership rules, allowing for even more consolidation. At key moments along the way, media conglomerates backed down amid corporate pressure, avoided stories that Wall Street wanted hidden and parroted government lies. And with media industry consolidation and mass layoffs of local journalists, oligarchs and government leaders could more easily narrow the political discourse, knowing that dissenting viewpoints would be shadowbanned or simply shut out \\u2013 and have nowhere to make inconvenient reporting heard. Of course, every now and then, the sound of protest managed to slip through the matrix. For example, just after Clinton signed the bill accelerating media mergers, Saturday Night Live writers managed to slip this Schoolhouse Rock spoof about media consolidation on to the national television airwaves. It was promptly erased from all future reruns. In the Trump era, there is no longer any attempt to obscure what\\u2019s really going on. Nine years ago, as Trump was starting his authoritarian ascent and bashing journalists, CBS\\u2019s CEO didn\\u2019t sound an alarm \\u2013 he instead seemed thrilled, declaring that the circus-like environment \\u201cmay not be good for America, but it\\u2019s damn good for CBS\\u201d. Critics such as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were once mercilessly ridiculed for suggesting that billionaire owners politically influence their media properties \\u2013 but today that influence is on display for all to see. Few even bother to pretend that all the media industry mergers, defunding, purges and surrenders have nothing to do with oligarchs\\u2019 self-serving ideological project. Quite the opposite \\u2013 if you read between the lines, it\\u2019s almost as if they are bragging about their role in the movement Powell ignited. Indeed, Weiss\\u2019s own Substack \\u2013 which was reportedly sold to CBS\\u2019s parent company for $150m \\u2013 just published an essay from a former News Corporation executive and e-cigarette company executive effusively valorizing Powell. In that Free Press hagiography, Powell is presented not as a zealot who published an ideological manifesto and sculpted radical precedents legalizing corruption. Instead, he is depicted as \\u201cthoughtful, measured, and willing to listen to others\\u201d as well as \\u201cless partisan and more cautious\\u201d than other jurists.

The host said his comments on Wednesday were “extremely callous”. Kilmeade’s about-face came amid a climate in which people across the US are either being fired from or disciplined at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Turning Point USA’s executive director, Charlie Kirk, who was shot to death at an event in Utah on Wednesday. Mere hours before the conservative political activist was killed, while on the rightwing Fox News program Fox &amp; Friends, Kilmeade and two other hosts were discussing the killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman who was fatally stabbed on a commuter train in North Carolina in August. The man charged with killing Zarutska at random in Charlotte had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had 14 prior criminal arrests. Surveillance video of the Zarutska’s killing went viral online. During the Fox and Friends appearance on Wednesday discussing Zarutska’s death, co-host Lawrence Jones said unhoused people with mental illness should either accept the publicly funded programs to help in their situation or be jailed. “Involuntary lethal injection or something,” Kilmeade responded to Jones. “Just kill ’em.” Kilmeade faced widespread backlash for his comments. Among those to respond was California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who on social media posted a biblical verse reading: “Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.” On Sunday morning, during an appearance with Jones on Fox &amp; Friends Weekends, Kilmeade apologized for his idea of killing those who are unhoused and mentally ill. “I wrongly said they should get lethal injections” on Wednesday, Kilmeade said. “I apologize for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina – and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.” Unlike others who were deemed to have made offensive comments about Kirk’s death, Kilmeade remained employed by Fox News. His professional fate struck a sharp contrast with Dowd, a veteran political analyst fired by MSNBC for suggesting on air that Kirk’s far-right rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that killed him. “Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said. “You can’t stop with these sort of awful thats you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.” The network and Dowd each separately issued apologies. But in a Substack article published on Friday, Dowd said he had been victimized by a “rightwing media mob” and that words he spoke before knowing Kirk had been the target of a shooting were misconstrued. “Kilmeade is advocating for extrajudicial killings on FOX, yet Matthew Dowd was fired by MSNBC [for] pointing out Charlie Kirk’s dangerous rhetoric,” author Shannon Watts said on X. “This moral asymmetry in the media and online is destroying democracy.” Zarutska’s killing has become an inflection point for Republicans, who are blaming Democratic policies in certain US cities for such crimes. Studies show that people experiencing homelessness are more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators. And other studies have shown that mental illness is not a predictor of future violence.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/14/fox-brian-kilmeade-apology-homelessness-comments', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7002097d15a54ffde881bcd5ce5cb3924d2f63/183_0_2238_1791/500.jpg', '2025-09-15 00:00:32', '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/14\\/fox-brian-kilmeade-apology-homelessness-comments\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-09-14T17:00:32Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Fox News host apologizes for \\u2018extremely callous\\u2019 remarks on unhoused people\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/14\\/fox-brian-kilmeade-apology-homelessness-comments\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/14\\/fox-brian-kilmeade-apology-homelessness-comments\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Fox News host apologizes for \\u2018extremely callous\\u2019 remarks on unhoused people\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Calls rose for Brian Kilmeade to be fired after saying people facing homelessness and mental illness should be executed<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Calls rose for Brian Kilmeade to be fired after saying people facing homelessness and mental illness should be executed\",\"byline\":\"Jos\\u00e9 Olivares\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"5b7002097d15a54ffde881bcd5ce5cb3924d2f63\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/5b7002097d15a54ffde881bcd5ce5cb3924d2f63\\/183_0_2238_1791\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"man in suit looks ahead, smiling\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Fox &amp; Friends host Brian Kilmeade in New York City on 17 October 2024.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Ted Shaffrey\\/AP<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/fox-news\\\">Fox News<\\/a> host Brian Kilmeade apologized on Sunday for saying days earlier that people who are experiencing <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/society\\/homelessness\\\">homelessness<\\/a> and mental illnesses should be executed \\u2013 remarks that prompted calls for him to be fired.<\\/p> <p>The host said his comments on Wednesday were \\u201cextremely callous\\u201d.<\\/p> <p>Kilmeade\\u2019s about-face came amid a climate in which people across the US are either <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/13\\/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\\\">being fired from or disciplined<\\/a> at their jobs amid a coordinated effort to clamp down on commentary that is critical about Turning Point USA\\u2019s executive director, Charlie Kirk, who was <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/charlie-kirk-shooting\\\">shot to death<\\/a> at an event in Utah on Wednesday.<\\/p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/13\\/charlie-kirk-shooting-people-fired-social-media\\\">Several people fired after clampdown on speech over Charlie Kirk shooting<\\/a> <\\/p> <\\/aside>  <p>Mere hours before the conservative political activist was killed, while on the rightwing Fox News program Fox &amp; Friends, Kilmeade and two other hosts were discussing the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/09\\/north-carolina-ukraine-woman-stabbing\\\">killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska<\\/a>, a Ukrainian woman who was fatally stabbed on a commuter train in North Carolina in August.<\\/p> <p>The man charged with killing Zarutska at random in Charlotte had reportedly been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had 14 prior criminal arrests.

(138, NULL, NULL, 'media/2025/oct/06/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news', 'Who is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?', 'Ex-NYT writer who launched ‘anti-woke commentary’ website will report directly to Paramount Skydance head David Ellison', 'Paramount Skydance has appointed Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who launched an “anti-woke” commentary website, as editor-in-chief of CBS News. Five years after an acrimonious exit from the New York Times, Weiss, 41, has been installed at the top of one of the most venerated institutions in US news – solidifying the meteoric rise of a divisive figure in media. She will report directly to David Ellison, the son of the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison and head of Paramount Skydance, the company that owns CBS News, which has acquired the Free Press, Weiss’s media startup. As editor-in-chief, Weiss will probably play a major role in shaping news coverage at the network. Where did Weiss get her start? Weiss held editorial roles at Jewish news outlets early in her career, including Haaretz, the Forward and Tablet. In 2013, she joined the opinion staff at the Wall Street Journal. In 2017, she joined Brett Stephens in moving to the New York Times’ opinion desk, where she started writing her own column. What did she do at the New York Times? As a journalist at the New York Times, Weiss developed a reputation for both criticizing Donald Trump in his first term and cracking down on the left’s cancel culture, from cultural appropriation to protests on college campuses. In the swirls of the #MeToo movement, she penned a viral op-ed defending comedian Aziz Ansari, who was accused of sexual misconduct in an anonymous essay. Weiss said at the time that the essay “transforms what ought to be a movement for women’s empowerment into an emblem for female helplessness”. Why did Weiss leave the Times? Weiss’s departure from the Times increased her profile even more. In July 2020, she published a public resignation letter, addressed to Times publisher AG Schulzberger, where she accused the company of becoming partisan, and reporting stories “to satisfy the narrowest of audiences”. She also said she was “the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views”. The Times said at the time it was committed to “fostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue” between its employees. What is the Free Press? Months after her departure from the Times, Weiss started a newsletter called Common Sense. The newsletter eventually expanded into a media startup, the Free Press, which publishes newsletters and podcasts. The company received backing from investors including the venture capitalists Marc Andreesen and David Sacks and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. At the Free Press, Weiss published controversial reports and series, including the podcast The Witch Trials of JK Rowling, about the Harry Potter author and her clash with liberals over her views on trans people, and a report on the Columbia pro-Palestine encampments with the headline “Camping Out at Columbia’s Communist Coachella”. The author of a book titled How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss is a longtime, staunch supporter of Israel and has utilized the Free Press to defend the country during the war in Gaza. Why is Paramount Skydance acquiring the Free Press? Skydance Media made an agreement with the Trump administration that its content will promote a “diversity of viewpoints” in the company’s bid to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to merge with Paramount Global. The FCC agreed to the merger in July, which saw Skydance pay $8bn to merge with Paramount, making Ellison in charge of the new Paramount Skydance company. Ahead of the merger, Paramount Global also paid $16m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit the president had filed against 60 Minutes, a move that was largely criticized by media watchdogs. Paramount also announced the 2026 cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s show, which was widely seen as a capitulation to Trump. Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commissions, which greenlit the merger, said that he was “pleased” with commitments the company made to reform CBS. In a letter to Carr, Skydance said it would ensure that the new company’s “array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum”. Paramount Skydance is also reportedly preparing to make a bid to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the company that owns CNN. On Monday, Ellison suggested the acquisition of the Free Press – and Weiss’s appointment as editor-in-chief – would help CBS News to reach “the majority of the country”.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/06/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d20eacbe6763e8b3d95f35a3db97ec579b01e189/520_0_5200_4160/500.jpg', '2025-10-06 19:59:28', '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/oct\\/06\\/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-06T12:59:28Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Who is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/06\\/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/06\\/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Who is Bari Weiss, the new editor-in-chief of CBS News?\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Ex-NYT writer who launched \\u2018anti-woke commentary\\u2019 website will report directly to Paramount Skydance head David Ellison<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Ex-NYT writer who launched \\u2018anti-woke commentary\\u2019 website will report directly to Paramount Skydance head David Ellison\",\"byline\":\"Lauren Aratani\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"d20eacbe6763e8b3d95f35a3db97ec579b01e189\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/d20eacbe6763e8b3d95f35a3db97ec579b01e189\\/520_0_5200_4160\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Bari Weiss in Los Angeles in September 2023. \\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Bari Weiss in Los Angeles in September 2023. <br><\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Francine Orr\\/Los Angeles Times\\/Getty Images<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>Paramount Skydance has appointed Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who launched an \\u201canti-woke\\u201d commentary website, as <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/06\\/bari-weiss-cbs-news-paramount-free-press\\\">editor-in-chief of CBS News<\\/a>.<\\/p> <aside class=\\\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\\\"> <p> <span>Related: <\\/span><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/ng-interactive\\/2025\\/sep\\/10\\/bari-weiss-cbs\\\">Disgruntled NYT journalist to \\u2018anti-woke\\u2019 power grab: how far can Bari Weiss go?<\\/a> <\\/p> <\\/aside>  <p>Five years after an acrimonious exit from the<em> <\\/em>New York Times, Weiss, 41, has been installed at the top of one of the most venerated institutions in US news \\u2013 solidifying the meteoric rise of a divisive figure in media.<\\/p> <p>She will report directly to David Ellison, the son of the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison and head of Paramount Skydance, the company that owns CBS News, which has acquired the Free Press, Weiss\\u2019s media startup.<\\/p> <p>As editor-in-chief, Weiss will probably play a major role in shaping news coverage at the network.<\\/p> <h2>Where did Weiss get her start?<\\/h2> <p>Weiss held editorial roles at Jewish news outlets early in her career, including Haaretz, the Forward and Tablet.

Five years after an acrimonious exit from the New York Times, Weiss, 41, has been installed at the top of one of the most venerated institutions in US news \\u2013 solidifying the meteoric rise of a divisive figure in media. She will report directly to David Ellison, the son of the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison and head of Paramount Skydance, the company that owns CBS News, which has acquired the Free Press, Weiss\\u2019s media startup. As editor-in-chief, Weiss will probably play a major role in shaping news coverage at the network. Where did Weiss get her start? Weiss held editorial roles at Jewish news outlets early in her career, including Haaretz, the Forward and Tablet. In 2013, she joined the opinion staff at the Wall Street Journal. In 2017, she joined Brett Stephens in moving to the New York Times\\u2019 opinion desk, where she started writing her own column. What did she do at the New York Times? As a journalist at the New York Times, Weiss developed a reputation for both criticizing Donald Trump in his first term and cracking down on the left\\u2019s cancel culture, from cultural appropriation to protests on college campuses. In the swirls of the #MeToo movement, she penned a viral op-ed defending comedian Aziz Ansari, who was accused of sexual misconduct in an anonymous essay. Weiss said at the time that the essay \\u201ctransforms what ought to be a movement for women\\u2019s empowerment into an emblem for female helplessness\\u201d. Why did Weiss leave the Times? Weiss\\u2019s departure from the Times increased her profile even more. In July 2020, she published a public resignation letter, addressed to Times publisher AG Schulzberger, where she accused the company of becoming partisan, and reporting stories \\u201cto satisfy the narrowest of audiences\\u201d. She also said she was \\u201cthe subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views\\u201d. The Times said at the time it was committed to \\u201cfostering an environment of honest, searching and empathetic dialogue\\u201d between its employees. What is the Free Press? Months after her departure from the Times, Weiss started a newsletter called Common Sense. The newsletter eventually expanded into a media startup, the Free Press, which publishes newsletters and podcasts. The company received backing from investors including the venture capitalists Marc Andreesen and David Sacks and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. At the Free Press, Weiss published controversial reports and series, including the podcast The Witch Trials of JK Rowling, about the Harry Potter author and her clash with liberals over her views on trans people, and a report on the Columbia pro-Palestine encampments with the headline \\u201cCamping Out at Columbia\\u2019s Communist Coachella\\u201d. The author of a book titled How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Weiss is a longtime, staunch supporter of Israel and has utilized the Free Press to defend the country during the war in Gaza. Why is Paramount Skydance acquiring the Free Press? Skydance Media made an agreement with the Trump administration that its content will promote a \\u201cdiversity of viewpoints\\u201d in the company\\u2019s bid to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to merge with Paramount Global. The FCC agreed to the merger in July, which saw Skydance pay $8bn to merge with Paramount, making Ellison in charge of the new Paramount Skydance company. Ahead of the merger, Paramount Global also paid $16m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit the president had filed against 60 Minutes, a move that was largely criticized by media watchdogs. Paramount also announced the 2026 cancellation of Stephen Colbert\\u2019s show, which was widely seen as a capitulation to Trump. Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commissions, which greenlit the merger, said that he was \\u201cpleased\\u201d with commitments the company made to reform CBS. In a letter to Carr, Skydance said it would ensure that the new company\\u2019s \\u201carray of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum\\u201d. Paramount Skydance is also reportedly preparing to make a bid to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the company that owns CNN. On Monday, Ellison suggested the acquisition of the Free Press \\u2013 and Weiss\\u2019s appointment as editor-in-chief \\u2013 would help CBS News to reach \\u201cthe majority of the country\\u201d.\",\"charCount\":\"4457\",\"shouldHideReaderRevenue\":\"false\",\"showAffiliateLinks\":\"false\",\"bylineHtml\":\"<a href=\\\"profile\\/lauren-aratani\\\">Lauren Aratani<\\/a>\",\"showTableOfContents\":\"false\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', '2025-11-10 01:15:26', NULL);

Speaking to host Martha MacCallum, Mamdani was asked about funding for his proposals, which include freezing increases on rent-stabilized apartments, providing free buses and offering free childcare – and whether other services would be cut to achieve those goals. “I don’t think we have to cut,” Mamdani said. “I’ve spoken about raising taxes on the wealthiest. And, frankly, this is an issue that we have here in New York City, and, frankly, even across this country.” Mamdani said he had spoken to people who voted for Donald Trump in New York who told him it was the “cost of living” that “drove them to vote” for the president. Mamdani said that, despite that, “what we’re seeing time and time again is we’re more focused on the question of billionaires and the most profitable corporations than we are on people who can’t even afford to make ends meet in the city”. Following his surprise victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, Mamdani has for months led the polls to be New York’s next mayor. A survey released by Quinnipiac last week showed Mamdani winning 46% of the vote to the former New York governor’s 33%. The Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, was at 15%. That rise has brought attention from outlets such as Fox News, which has closely covered Mamdani, sometimes publishing multiple news stories on him a day. Jesse Watters, the network’s prime-time host, has been a frequent critic, describing Mamdani as a “communist”, which he is not, and calling him “Kamala Harris with a beard”, while Sean Hannity suggested that the rise of Mamdani, who is Muslim, is evidence that “an extremism is taking root right before your very eyes”. In an interview that rehashed several rightwing critiques of Mamdani, MacCallum suggested he may lack the qualifications for the role. “President Trump said that you never worked a day in your life,” MacCallum told Mamdani, before asking what qualifies him to run the city. In response, Mamdani spoke directly into the camera, alluding to how the outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, bowed to pressure from the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration crackdowns – before the Trump-led justice department dropped a federal corruption case against him. “I want to take this moment, because you spoke about President Trump, and he may be watching right now, and I just want to speak directly to the president,” Mamdani said. “I will not be a mayor like Mayor [Eric] Adams, who will call you to figure out how to stay out of jail. I won’t be a disgraced governor like Andrew Cuomo, who will call you to ask how to win this election. I can do those things on my own. I will, however, be a mayor who is ready to speak at any time to lower the cost of living. “That’s the way that I’m going to lead this city. That’s the partnership I want to build, not only with Washington DC, but [with] anyone across this country.” The interview came as Mamdani prepared for a debate with Cuomo and Sliwa on Thursday night. Adams suspended his re-election campaign in late September. Cuomo, who has centered his campaign on reducing crime, will likely seek to contrast his decades of experience in politics with Mamdani’s newcomer status. The former governor, who resigned in 2021 after he was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, has run numerous ads attacking Mamdani. The issue of the Israel-Hamas peace deal is likely to come up, given Cuomo’s strong support for Israel and Mamdani’s opposing stance. Mamdani has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza and called the bombing of the territory a “genocide”. Mamdani was asked questions about the region on Wednesday, including whether he would give credit to Trump for the fledgling deal. Mamdani, stressing that his focus would be on New York rather than international politics, said he was thankful for the ceasefire, adding: “I have hope that it will actually endure and that it will be lasting.” “I think it’s too early to [give credit],” Mamdani said. “But if it proves to be something that is lasting, something that is durable, then I think that that’s where you give credit.” This article was amended on 16 October 2025 to clarify that the recent Quinnipiac poll showed Curtis Sliwa at 15%, not 22%, as we originally said.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/zohran-mamdani-fox-news-trump', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/048ef463f5187da0964930616cd4832d5f9a78e5/213_0_3052_2441/500.jpg', '2025-10-16 04:12:45', '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/oct\\/15\\/zohran-mamdani-fox-news-trump\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-15T21:12:45Z\",\"webTitle\":\"\\u2018He may be watching\\u2019: Mamdani on Fox News speaks directly to Trump\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/oct\\/15\\/zohran-mamdani-fox-news-trump\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/oct\\/15\\/zohran-mamdani-fox-news-trump\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"\\u2018He may be watching\\u2019: Mamdani on Fox News speaks directly to Trump\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>New York mayoral contender steps into lion\\u2019s den and says he is \\u2018ready to speak at any time\\u2019 to help lower cost of living<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"New York mayoral contender steps into lion\\u2019s den and says he is \\u2018ready to speak at any time\\u2019 to help lower cost of living\",\"byline\":\"Adam Gabbatt\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"048ef463f5187da0964930616cd4832d5f9a78e5\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/048ef463f5187da0964930616cd4832d5f9a78e5\\/0_0_3500_2441\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"a man in a suit speaks while seated at a table on a televised program\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"697\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Zohran Mamdani on Martha MacCallum\\u2019s Fox News show on Wednesday.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Evan Agostini\\/Invision\\/AP<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/zohran-mamdani\\\">Zohran Mamdani<\\/a>, the leading candidate to be the next mayor of New York, stepped into the lion\\u2019s den on Wednesday when he sat for an interview with Fox News, the rightwing news organization that has spent weeks demonizing him and his democratic socialist goals.<\\/p> <p>Speaking to host Martha MacCallum, Mamdani was asked about funding for his proposals, which include freezing increases on rent-stabilized apartments, providing free buses and offering free childcare \\u2013 and whether other services would be cut to achieve those goals.<\\/p> <p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we have to cut,\\u201d Mamdani said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve spoken about raising taxes on the wealthiest.

(140, NULL, NULL, 'business/2025/sep/12/uk-economy-flatlines-july-grim-news-rachel-reeves', 'UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel Reeves', 'Official GDP figures confirm widely expected slowdown after strong expansion in first half of the year', 'The UK economy flatlined in July, according to official figures, in grim news for Rachel Reeves as she gears up for a challenging budget. It was a slowdown compared with June, when the economy grew by 0.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics. GDP expanded strongly in the first half of the year, making the UK the fastest-growing economy in the G7, but it had been widely expected to slow in the second half. The ONS said that growth in the services and construction sectors in July was offset by a 0.9% fall in the production sector, which includes manufacturing. The downbeat data will raise questions about Labour’s promise to kickstart the economy. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We know there’s more to do to boost growth, because, whilst our economy isn’t broken, it does feel stuck. That’s the result of years of underinvestment, which we’re determined to reverse through our plan for change.” The ONS said that GDP grew by 0.2% in the three months to July, compared with the three months to April, down from 0.3% in the three months to June. Statisticians see three-month figures as a better guide to the underlying health of the economy than one-month data, which tends to be more volatile. The ONS director of economic statistics, Liz McKeown, said: “Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months. While services growth held up, production fell back further. “Within services, health, computer programming and office support services all performed well, while the falls in production were driven by broad-based weakness across manufacturing industries.” The pound weakened after the news, to trade 0.2% lower at $1.355 against the US dollar by mid-morning in London. Business groups have blamed Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contribution, which came into force in April alongside a significant rise in the national living wage, for constraining growth. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) responded to the data by warning Reeves against levying more taxes on business. Stuart Morrison, the BCC’s research manager, said: “The business landscape remains challenging, particularly for SMEs [small and medium-size enterprises], with cost pressures impacting investment, recruitment and trade. “The government has acknowledged it has asked a lot of business in the past year. Our message is now clear – there must be no more taxes on business in the autumn budget.” The chancellor is widely expected to have to present a package of tax increases when she delivers her second budget on 26 November, to compensate for an anticipated downgrade in the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts. However, after the news of zero growth in July, economists warned that speculation about tax increases was likely to continue weighing on confidence. Fergus Jimenez-England, an associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Economic activity in the third quarter will be constrained by fiscal uncertainty weighing on household and business sentiments. Growth at this pace will do little to ease the fiscal challenges confronting the chancellor this autumn.” Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “The government talks of going full-throttle on growth but the reality is they have left the handbrake on. “Their growth-crushing jobs tax risks hollowing out our high streets and ministers’ refusal to jettison their shortsighted red lines on cutting red tape with Europe is holding back our exporters.” Trade data published alongside the GDP update showed the UK’s goods deficit widening by £3bn in the three months to July, to £61.9bn. The ONS said exports to the US rose by £800m in July but had not returned to the levels seen before Donald Trump’s tariffs were imposed. The slowdown in economic growth comes alongside higher-than-expected inflation, which jumped to 3.8% in July, prompting investors to rein in expectations of further interest rate cuts from the Bank of England in the coming months. The Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee is expected to leave rates on hold at 4% when it meets next Thursday.

Angelina Jolie put on a beekeeping suit for Guerlain and David Beckham proudly presented the King with a pot of honey from his bees in Oxfordshire. So many people wanting to do good have set up hives in their gardens or on roofs that they have become a symbol of sustainability. Of course, farming honeybees is a great way to make delicious honey, but there is a sting in the tail – keeping hives doesn’t help wild pollinators. Successful campaigns to “save the bees” have struck a chord with the public, but domestic honeybees don’t need saving because they are not in decline – setting up beehives is almost the equivalent of farming chickens to save wild birds. Meanwhile, there is a huge swathe of pollinators – about 270 species of solitary bee and 25 species of bumblebee – that are in real crisis and urgently need our help. Many of these threatened species are becoming rarer every year. More on what we can do to help, after this week’s most important reads. Essential reads Human-made global warming ‘caused two in three heat deaths in Europe this summer’ A tiny town in Idaho dodged incineration in 2024. Will the next wildfire take it out? ‘You’re going about your day and suddenly see a little Godzilla’: Bangkok reckons with a giant lizard boom In focus Honeybees are essential for pollinating food crops (which we, obviously, need) but research suggests that when honeybee numbers boom, they negatively impact wild pollinators – especially in places where they are non-native such as Australia and America. High numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations because they outcompete them for nectar and pollen. They can forage further than other bees, but also there can be as many as 50,000 of them in a hive – far more than the nests that native bees live in. That’s not a problem when flowers are plentiful, but in environments where resources are limited, wild bees may struggle to find food. My reporting on this story this week led me to the work of Keng-Lou James Hung, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Oklahoma, who has been studying how this global bee battle is playing out on San Diego’s coastal scrub, where non-native honeybees have gone feral – living wild, not in a hive. Each spring, after the winter rains, this scrub landscape bursts into life. Sagebrush, white sage and buckwheat unfurl their leaves, throwing sweet aromas into the hot air. The landscape has all the hallmarks of a pristine ecosystem, but Hung’s research shows another story is unfolding here. In July, he published a study finding that 98% of bee biomass (the weight of all bees) in that area came from feral honeybees. They removed about 80% of pollen during the first day a flower opened, according to the paper, published in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity. “Context is king,” Hung told me. “As our study showed, in places like San Diego, it seems likelier that they are exploiting food resources to the detriment of native pollinators. Species aren’t inherently “good” or “bad” but there are circumstances in which the introduction of species to certain locations could be problematic, just like goats and cats introduced to oceanic islands,” he added. Such high rates of pollen extraction leave little for the more than 700 species of native bees in the region, which need pollen to raise their offspring. Some of those species have not been seen for decades. Scientists are finding this kind of story elsewhere in the world, including an experiment on an isolated Italian island showing that honeybees were causing declines in wild pollinators (you’ll have to read my piece to find out more about that). “As a researcher, I always get asked whether all the bees are in trouble, which at least means that people have recognised invertebrates as species that they should be concerned about, so that’s a good start,” says Hung. “We can’t blame the managed honeybee PR machine for being so good at its job; we just need to step up the game on native bee conservation advocacy and education,” he says. How people see the issue will influence how they take action, says Hung. “People who mistake honeybees as conservation targets would donate to causes that support honeybee health research and vote for policies that support beekeepers; if they had all the correct information, they might have instead chosen to allocate some significant portion of those commitments to native bee research and conservation instead.” For people who want to help all bees, the best way to do it is to plant a variety of flowers that bloom from early spring right through to late autumn. Many “weedy” plants are rich sources of pollen and nectar, so ditch weedkiller. Leave areas undisturbed where solitary bees and bumblebees can nest. Also, be lazy! Mowing lawns less frequently can lead to an increase in bee abundance of up to 30%. “I am quite encouraged that all over the world, there is an increased awareness of native bees; and more and more people now know that honeybees are not native to many parts of the world,” says Hung. “Overall I’m optimistic that people are more willing to accept nuanced answers and diversify their conservation interests.” Read more: Wild bees visit different flowers to balance diet, study shows The best way to help bees?

Angelina Jolie put on a beekeeping suit for Guerlain and David Beckham proudly presented the King with a pot of honey from his bees in Oxfordshire. So many people wanting to do good have set up hives in their gardens or on roofs that they have become a symbol of sustainability. Of course, farming honeybees is a great way to make delicious honey, but there is a sting in the tail \\u2013 keeping hives doesn\\u2019t help wild pollinators. Successful campaigns to \\u201csave the bees\\u201d have struck a chord with the public, but domestic honeybees don\\u2019t need saving because they are not in decline \\u2013 setting up beehives is almost the equivalent of farming chickens to save wild birds. Meanwhile, there is a huge swathe of pollinators \\u2013 about 270 species of solitary bee and 25 species of bumblebee \\u2013 that are in real crisis and urgently need our help. Many of these threatened species are becoming rarer every year. More on what we can do to help, after this week\\u2019s most important reads. Essential reads Human-made global warming \\u2018caused two in three heat deaths in Europe this summer\\u2019 A tiny town in Idaho dodged incineration in 2024. Will the next wildfire take it out? \\u2018You\\u2019re going about your day and suddenly see a little Godzilla\\u2019: Bangkok reckons with a giant lizard boom In focus Honeybees are essential for pollinating food crops (which we, obviously, need) but research suggests that when honeybee numbers boom, they negatively impact wild pollinators \\u2013 especially in places where they are non-native such as Australia and America. High numbers of honeybees can actively harm wild bee populations because they outcompete them for nectar and pollen. They can forage further than other bees, but also there can be as many as 50,000 of them in a hive \\u2013 far more than the nests that native bees live in. That\\u2019s not a problem when flowers are plentiful, but in environments where resources are limited, wild bees may struggle to find food. My reporting on this story this week led me to the work of Keng-Lou James Hung, an assistant professor of biology at the University of Oklahoma, who has been studying how this global bee battle is playing out on San Diego\\u2019s coastal scrub, where non-native honeybees have gone feral \\u2013 living wild, not in a hive. Each spring, after the winter rains, this scrub landscape bursts into life. Sagebrush, white sage and buckwheat unfurl their leaves, throwing sweet aromas into the hot air. The landscape has all the hallmarks of a pristine ecosystem, but Hung\\u2019s research shows another story is unfolding here. In July, he published a study finding that 98% of bee biomass (the weight of all bees) in that area came from feral honeybees. They removed about 80% of pollen during the first day a flower opened, according to the paper, published in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity. \\u201cContext is king,\\u201d Hung told me. \\u201cAs our study showed, in places like San Diego, it seems likelier that they are exploiting food resources to the detriment of native pollinators. Species aren\\u2019t inherently \\u201cgood\\u201d or \\u201cbad\\u201d but there are circumstances in which the introduction of species to certain locations could be problematic, just like goats and cats introduced to oceanic islands,\\u201d he added. Such high rates of pollen extraction leave little for the more than 700 species of native bees in the region, which need pollen to raise their offspring. Some of those species have not been seen for decades. Scientists are finding this kind of story elsewhere in the world, including an experiment on an isolated Italian island showing that honeybees were causing declines in wild pollinators (you\\u2019ll have to read my piece to find out more about that). \\u201cAs a researcher, I always get asked whether all the bees are in trouble, which at least means that people have recognised invertebrates as species that they should be concerned about, so that\\u2019s a good start,\\u201d says Hung. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t blame the managed honeybee PR machine for being so good at its job; we just need to step up the game on native bee conservation advocacy and education,\\u201d he says.

(143, NULL, NULL, 'media/2025/oct/31/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news', 'Who will Bari Weiss pick as the next anchor of CBS Evening News?', 'With John Dickerson heading out and show’s ratings struggling, new CBS editor-in-chief is looking at several anchors at rival networks', 'For more than half a century, CBS Evening News has been synonymous with the network’s reputation for journalistic excellence, with anchors such as Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather holding court on a nightly basis. Now, it will be up to Bari Weiss, CBS News’s editor in chief, who has no previous background in television, to help decide what comes next for the show, which has struggled to attract viewers. On Monday, CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson – one of the network’s best-known personalities – announced he would leave the network at the end of the year, leaving behind his fellow anchor, Maurice DuBois. While the network has not addressed DuBois’ fate, network insiders expect that CBS News will return to a single anchor format. The question now is whether Weiss and Tom Cibrowski, the network president, will choose an internal candidate, or hire from the outside, as they put their imprint on a ratings-challenged show that, like its rivals, is struggling with the challenges of the digital age. Network management had attempted to shake things up by introducing a new format for the show in January. In addition to having co-anchors, the show pivoted to a formula that prioritized longer, more deeply reported stories rather than hard news run-downs from Washington. Rather than jolting the show out of its long-time position in third place, trailing both ABC World News Tonight and the NBC Nightly News in viewers, the audience dropped off even further. If the network chooses to promote from within, Tony Dokoupil, the morning show co-anchor, stands as good a chance as anyone. Norah O’Donnell, who anchored the show from 2019 to 2024, has also been mentioned. But Weiss seems interested in hiring an external candidate and has shown interest in several top anchors. The problem is that many of them are already under contract at their existing networks for several more years. Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor, is one of those external options, but the evening news anchor made clear this week that he is signed with Fox through 2028. Another candidate, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, is also under contract at the network – though he has a pre-existing relationship with CBS News through his role as a correspondent on 60 Minutes. Weiss has also expressed interest in another Fox anchor, Dana Perino, the Guardian has learned. But Perino, like Baier, is under contract for several more years – into the next decade, in her case – and cannot sign with a rival network. Perino appeared on Weiss’s Honesty with Bari Weiss podcast in May, and the two were effusive in praising each other. “The private Dana is even more gracious and shining than the public one,” Weiss said. “You are a person who models, frankly, just classy behavior, the kind of class that I think a lot of people have forgotten.” Perino described herself as “a huge fan” of Weiss and her wife, Nellie Bowles, and said that their website the Free Press is “one of the best things that has kept me more informed and smarter, and also super entertained”. In chatter among employees, another name that has come up – but isn’t likely in serious consideration – is Shepard Smith, a former Fox News anchor, who resigned suddenly from the network in 2019. He signed with financial network CNBC to anchor a nightly newscast, but the experiment failed and he left the network in 2022. Since then, Smith has kept a low profile. Even if Weiss can land a big-name outsider, it’s an open question whether it would actually make a difference. CBS News has gone through a host of evening news anchors – since 2011, the show has been hosted by Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Anthony Mason, Jeff Glor and O’Donnell, in addition to the current pairing – but none have been able to change the evening news pecking order. And with every switch behind the anchor desk, “you have sent viewers away each time”, said a former CBS News executive who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Generally, viewers tend to stick with their evening news show of choice and seem unwilling to try out the competition. While NBC recently had a change in the anchor chair, with Tom Llamas replacing longtime anchor Lester Holt, ABC has seen continuity with David Muir leading the show since 2014. This season, Muir’s show has averaged 7.5 million viewers, comfortably ahead of NBC (5.7 million viewers) and far ahead of CBS (3.7 million viewers). “She’s got a disaster on her hands at the Evening News and she’s got to fix the Evening News, and that’s got to be her new project,” said Tom Bettag, a lecturer at the University of Maryland’s journalism school who spent 22 years at CBS News, including a five-year stint as executive producer of the nightly show under Dan Rather. While the show’s ratings aren’t what they were, Bettag said the show is still essential to the identity of the network, not to mention a reliable source of advertiser revenue. “If they have a really strong Evening News, it lifts the whole place,” he added. CBS News employees – who were not authorized to comment – were less specific about what needs to change on the evening show and who the network should pick to anchor. “What they need is someone who plays a very good anchor man and hopefully has journalistic chops and a very talented show-runner,” one staffer told the Guardian, while another was more concise: “We need to just do a damn newscast. Don’t overthink it.” The CBS Evening News may not hold the place in society it once did, but what Weiss (and Cibrowski) decide to do with the show could hint at her longterm strategy and provide an early signal of whether she might be successful in turning around the network’s fortunes. “I wouldn’t say it’s the most important decision, but it’s probably the most telling decision, about where she’s taking the direction of the company,” the former CBS News executive said.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/31/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/efe609a8c42a1aaf28063f445eda1be8ccb19436/1_0_4998_4000/500.jpg', '2025-10-31 17:00:22', '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/oct\\/31\\/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-10-31T10:00:22Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Who will Bari Weiss pick as the next anchor of CBS Evening News?\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/31\\/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/oct\\/31\\/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Who will Bari Weiss pick as the next anchor of CBS Evening News?\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>With John Dickerson heading out and show\\u2019s ratings struggling, new CBS editor-in-chief is looking at several anchors at rival networks<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"With John Dickerson heading out and show\\u2019s ratings struggling, new CBS editor-in-chief is looking at several anchors at rival networks\",\"byline\":\"Jeremy Barr in Washington\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"efe609a8c42a1aaf28063f445eda1be8ccb19436\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/efe609a8c42a1aaf28063f445eda1be8ccb19436\\/1_0_4998_4000\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"A composite image of a woman speaking into a mic and a man seated behind a desk.\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">Bari Weiss and John Dickerson.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Composite: Gail Schulman\\/  Francine Orr<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>For more than half a century, CBS Evening News has been synonymous with the network\\u2019s reputation for journalistic excellence, with anchors such as Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather holding court on a nightly basis.

Now, it will be up to Bari Weiss, CBS News\\u2019s editor in chief, who has no previous background in television, to help decide what comes next for the show, which has struggled to attract viewers. On Monday, CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson \\u2013 one of the network\\u2019s best-known personalities \\u2013 announced he would leave the network at the end of the year, leaving behind his fellow anchor, Maurice DuBois. While the network has not addressed DuBois\\u2019 fate, network insiders expect that CBS News will return to a single anchor format. The question now is whether Weiss and Tom Cibrowski, the network president, will choose an internal candidate, or hire from the outside, as they put their imprint on a ratings-challenged show that, like its rivals, is struggling with the challenges of the digital age. Network management had attempted to shake things up by introducing a new format for the show in January. In addition to having co-anchors, the show pivoted to a formula that prioritized longer, more deeply reported stories rather than hard news run-downs from Washington. Rather than jolting the show out of its long-time position in third place, trailing both ABC World News Tonight and the NBC Nightly News in viewers, the audience dropped off even further. If the network chooses to promote from within, Tony Dokoupil, the morning show co-anchor, stands as good a chance as anyone. Norah O\\u2019Donnell, who anchored the show from 2019 to 2024, has also been mentioned. But Weiss seems interested in hiring an external candidate and has shown interest in several top anchors. The problem is that many of them are already under contract at their existing networks for several more years. Bret Baier, the Fox News anchor, is one of those external options, but the evening news anchor made clear this week that he is signed with Fox through 2028. Another candidate, Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, is also under contract at the network \\u2013 though he has a pre-existing relationship with CBS News through his role as a correspondent on 60 Minutes. Weiss has also expressed interest in another Fox anchor, Dana Perino, the Guardian has learned. But Perino, like Baier, is under contract for several more years \\u2013 into the next decade, in her case \\u2013 and cannot sign with a rival network. Perino appeared on Weiss\\u2019s Honesty with Bari Weiss podcast in May, and the two were effusive in praising each other. \\u201cThe private Dana is even more gracious and shining than the public one,\\u201d Weiss said. \\u201cYou are a person who models, frankly, just classy behavior, the kind of class that I think a lot of people have forgotten.\\u201d Perino described herself as \\u201ca huge fan\\u201d of Weiss and her wife, Nellie Bowles, and said that their website the Free Press is \\u201cone of the best things that has kept me more informed and smarter, and also super entertained\\u201d. In chatter among employees, another name that has come up \\u2013 but isn\\u2019t likely in serious consideration \\u2013 is Shepard Smith, a former Fox News anchor, who resigned suddenly from the network in 2019. He signed with financial network CNBC to anchor a nightly newscast, but the experiment failed and he left the network in 2022. Since then, Smith has kept a low profile. Even if Weiss can land a big-name outsider, it\\u2019s an open question whether it would actually make a difference. CBS News has gone through a host of evening news anchors \\u2013 since 2011, the show has been hosted by Katie Couric, Scott Pelley, Anthony Mason, Jeff Glor and O\\u2019Donnell, in addition to the current pairing \\u2013 but none have been able to change the evening news pecking order. And with every switch behind the anchor desk, \\u201cyou have sent viewers away each time\\u201d, said a former CBS News executive who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Generally, viewers tend to stick with their evening news show of choice and seem unwilling to try out the competition.

Household living standards are on the rise. The bad news? Just about everything else | Greg Jericho', 'Australia’s weak economic growth is not surprising when you factor in what’s going on with households, private investment, trade and government spending', 'There were early signs that the March GDP figures were not going to be good. To start with, the Bureau of Statistics’ new measure of household spending that covers about two-thirds of all household spending had already revealed that spending for the quarter was flat compared with a 1.6% jump in December quarter last year. So household spending was worse. Then last week the private capital expenditure figures revealed a 0.1% fall in investment in buildings and engineering, compared with a 0.2% rise in the December 2024 quarter. So private investment was worse. On Tuesday, the balance of payments revealed that trade in the first three months of this year was expected to “detract 0.1%pts from the March quarter” compared with adding 0.2%pts in December. So trade was worse. Just to top it off, on Tuesday the figures for government spending and investment showed that public demand fell in the March quarter and would also detract 0.1%pts from GDP growth compared with it adding 0.2%pts to GDP growth last December. So the impact of the public sector was worse. To be honest, once you take away households, private investment, trade and government spending, you really are not left with much. So it came to be. In the March quarter of this year, GDP growth was just 0.2%, down from 0.6% in the December quarter. The only good news is the March quarter last year was pretty dire as well, so all up it meant annual growth remained steady at a still extremely weak 1.3%. If the graph does not display click here This weak growth meant that per capita GDP fell again – the ninth quarter out of the past 11. This is not a good state of affairs, and certainly does not accord with the views of the Reserve Bank back in April when it looked at the first three months of this year and suggested that “the limited information available about activity in early 2025 suggested that the pick-up in GDP growth had been sustained”. Ahh well, at least they can say they were not wrong for long? Well no. In the minutes of the May board meeting released this week the RBA now suggested that “GDP growth had increased in the December quarter 2024 and year-ended growth looked to have picked up a little further in the March quarter”. Going from 1.3% growth in December to 1.3% growth in March is hardly “picked up”. The May Statement on Monetary Policy also predicted annual GDP growth in June of 1.8%. To get to that level, the economy would need to grow in April, May and June by 0.7% – the strongest quarter growth for three years. Here’s hoping … So what drove the growth that was there? Households were the biggest contributor to growth – although as in all things the context is key. Their contribution to the growth of the economy in the March quarter was about half what you would normally expect. If the graph does not display click here And a big reason for the increase in consumption was a jump in spending on electricity, gas and other fuels – due to the ending of some of the state government energy rebates (which also had an impact on inflation). That is not the type of spending you want to see driving households. All up the level of household consumption is well down on what would have been expected before the pandemic. The Reserve Bank’s interest rate rises did their job – they snuffed out spending. Clearly more rate cuts are needed to undo that damage and it is quite extraordinary that the RBA is so sanguine about it all: If the graph does not display click here The overall level of household spending and private-sector investment quickly rules out the use of the phrase “strong” when searching for a term to describe what is going on: If the graph does not display click here And that’s not surprising because while home loan rates have come down, the average discounted rate is still more than 300 basis point higher than it was at the start of 2022. But for small business owners taking out an overdraft loan, things are even worse – the rate is 400 basis point higher: If the graph does not display click here But let us not be too negative. One very good piece of news is that household living standards are on the rise. After two years, finally household disposable income per capita is above the level it was in March 2020: If the graph does not display click here One reason for this was there was a very slight decline in the level of mortgage repayments, due to the rate cut in February. This cut actually helped increased living standards in the first three months of this year. But that was a very small repair, given since March 2022 mortgage repayments have contributed about 63% of the fall in living standards: If the graph does not display click here That’s a sizeable chunk and it reinforces the damage that is done when the RBA so badly misreads the economy as it has. These figures highlight that not only should the Reserve Bank have cut rates in April but having made that error it compounded it by not cutting rates by at least 50 basis points last month. So far this year the RBA has kept misreading the economic situation and erred on the side of caution. Let us hope these weak figures spur it to cut rates when it meets next month and not suggest it still needs more time to see what is going on.

Though the shooting occurred just a day after protesters gathered outside to the station to condemn ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, Sacramento police said the motive in the case remained under investigation, with it not being immediately clear whether the gunfire was targeted or random. Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, faces counts of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm after his arrest in the case, Sacramento police said in a statement early Saturday. After he posted bail, the FBI arrested him with interference to communications of stations that are licensed by the federal government, according to officials. Shots were fired at ABC10, whose call letters are KXTV, just after 1.30pm Friday, police said. Officers spotted at least three gunshots into the window but said it was unclear whether they had been directed at the station building. The building was occupied at the time, but “fortunately, no one was injured”, said the Sacramento police’s public information officer, Anthony Gamble, during a news conference. Authorities confirmed that the gunshots appeared to have been fired from a vehicle. They asked witnesses with any information regarding the investigation to contact the Sacramento police’s dispatch center. Police said they arrested Hernandez with the help of the FBI after linking him to a car suspected of having been used to shoot at the station. He was arrested in Sacramento’s River Park neighborhood, which is in the north-eastern part of the city. On Thursday, video footage taken by the Sacramento Bee showed protesters gathered outside the ABC building, demonstrating against the suspension of Kimmel’s show after his commentary about the Trump administration’s response to the 10 September shooting death of far-right commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The protesters held up signs like “fight back”, “you’re next” and “first amendment”, referring to the part of the US constitution that guarantees US citizens the right to free speech. “What happened with Jimmy Kimmel yesterday really caused a lot of concern for our free speech rights,” one of the protesters told the Bee. Variety reported about the existence of an X account for Hernandez that contained “a steady stream of anti-Trump commentary”. On Thursday, the account reportedly posted: “Where is a good heart attack when we need it most?? Please Join in my thoughts and prayers for the physical demise of our fearful leader.” ABC10’s corporate owner, Tegna, issued a statement saying all of its employees were “safe and unharmed” after Friday’s gunfire. “While details are still limited … we are fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees,” the company’s statement said. The shots fired at the Sacramento news station came a week after authorities found a bomb had been placed under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah. The bomb didn’t detonate, but two men were arrested and could face charges of illegal weapon possession as well as threats to terrorism.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/62eab06ffc5ec32525b40d8d17cb57988be878e0/516_0_4028_3224/500.jpg', '2025-09-20 22:05:46', '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/20\\/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-09-20T15:05:46Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Police arrest man suspected of shooting into a Sacramento ABC news station\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/20\\/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/sep\\/20\\/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Police arrest man suspected of shooting into a Sacramento ABC news station\",\"standfirst\":\"<p>Police say the ABC10 building was occupied when shots were fired into the lobby but \\u2018no one was injured\\u2019<\\/p>\",\"trailText\":\"Police say the ABC10 building was occupied when shots were fired into the lobby but \\u2018no one was injured\\u2019\",\"byline\":\"Olivia Empson\",\"main\":\"<figure class=\\\"element element-image\\\" data-media-id=\\\"62eab06ffc5ec32525b40d8d17cb57988be878e0\\\"> <img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/62eab06ffc5ec32525b40d8d17cb57988be878e0\\/516_0_4028_3224\\/1000.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"a brick wall with a blue ABC10 sign on it and a window covered with a wooden board\\\" width=\\\"1000\\\" height=\\\"800\\\" class=\\\"gu-image\\\" \\/> <figcaption> <span class=\\\"element-image__caption\\\">A window that was stuck by gunfire is covered with a board at ABC10 (KXTV) in Sacramento, California, on 19 September 2025.<\\/span> <span class=\\\"element-image__credit\\\">Photograph: Fred Greaves\\/Reuters<\\/span> <\\/figcaption> <\\/figure>\",\"body\":\"<p>Police have <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/x.com\\/SacPolice\\/status\\/1969316857544130856\\\">arrested<\\/a> a man suspected of shooting into the lobby of Sacramento\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/abc\\\">ABC<\\/a> affiliate on Friday.<\\/p> <p>Though the shooting occurred just a day after protesters gathered outside to the station to condemn ABC\\u2019s suspension of <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/tv-and-radio\\/jimmy-kimmel\\\">Jimmy Kimmel<\\/a>\\u2019s late-night talkshow, Sacramento police said the motive in the case remained under investigation, with it not being immediately clear whether the gunfire was targeted or random.<\\/p> <p>Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, faces counts of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm after his arrest in the case, Sacramento police said in a statement early Saturday.

First, two federal judges issued back-to-back rulings in separate cases ordering the administration to use contingency funds to continue paying for food stamps under the Snap program. One judge in Rhode Island blocked the Trump administration from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of US cities, non-profit organizations and a trade union. At almost the same time, in a separate but similar case, a judge in Massachusetts ruled that the government must continue to fund the program that helps low-income households stave off food insecurity, in a case brought by the Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia and three governors who sued the administration. And later Friday, a US district judge in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive to overhaul US elections was unconstitutional. “Because our constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the states and to Congress, this court holds that the president lacks the authority to direct such changes,” judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her opinion. That’s a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in US elections.

She ruled that the proof-of-citizenship directive is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, dealing a blow to the administration and its allies. Read the full story Justice department seeks 2020 election records from Georgia county Trump’s justice department on Thursday asked election officials in Fulton county, Georgia, to turn over records related to the 2020 election, a request that underscores how the administration is trying to revive one of the president’s biggest falsehoods about the election he lost five years ago. Investigators have cleared Fulton county of malfeasance in 2020. Nonetheless, a Republican majority on the board voted to reopen the investigation last year. Read the full story Harrison Ford lays into Trump on climate Harrison Ford has said that Donald Trump’s assault on measures to address the climate crisis “scares the shit out of me” and makes the US president among the worst criminals in history. In a blistering attack, Ford told the Guardian Trump “doesn’t have any policies, he has whims. It scares the shit out of me. The ignorance, the hubris, the lies, the perfidy. [Trump] knows better, but he’s an instrument of the status quo and he’s making money, hand over fist, while the world goes to hell in a handbasket.” Read the full story How Stephen Miller is creating an ‘anti-immigration machine’ The historic shifts in US immigration under Donald Trump have been dictated by Stephen Miller, the president’s immigration czar, who in recent months has turned the state department’s visa and refugee operations into what some current and former diplomats have described as a personal fiefdom.

Trump called on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, a Republican known for defending Senate traditions, has repeatedly rejected proposals to weaken or remove the 60-vote rule. What is the filibuster and why does Trump want to get rid of it? Here’s what you need to know. More than half of Americans disapprove of Donald Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing and the construction of a new ballroom, according to a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos. According to the poll, 56% of the respondents disagree with Trump’s recent move while 28% are in favor of it.

Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order. It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada. Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote. US Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention. Read the full story US will limit number of refugees and give priority to white South Africans The Trump administration is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans. The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world. The administration published the news on Thursday in a notice on the Federal Registry. Read the full story Trump-Xi meeting: US president says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed Donald Trump has described crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea as “amazing”, saying their dispute over the supply of rare earths had been settled and that he would visit China in April. Xi Jinping has not commented on Thursday’s discussions but noted that the economic and trade teams from both countries had “reached a basic consensus on addressing our respective major concerns” during recent talks in Kuala Lumpur, according to Chinese state media. That had “provided the necessary conditions” for their meeting on Thursday, he added. Read the full story New York declares state of emergency to issue food banks $65m amid shutdown New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Thursday declared a state of emergency to free up funds so that she could issue $65m in assistance to food banks because federal funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on 1 November. Oregon and Virginia have also issued emergency declarations to release state cash to go towards emergency food assistance as the federal government shutdown imperils Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for nearly 42 million Americans.

Andrew did not object to the process, PA reported.

The shooting was the second such incident in the region in recent weeks.

Publication of the work was fast-tracked to provide prospective mothers and their doctors with reliable information after the Trump administration urged pregnant women to avoid paracetamol – also known as acetaminophen or Tylenol – claiming it was contributing to rising rates of autism. Speaking at the White House in September, the US president said women should talk to their doctor about limiting the use of the painkiller while pregnant and followed up with far stronger language, telling women to “fight like hell” not to take it. While rates of autism have risen in recent decades, many scientists believe the trend is driven by greater awareness, improvements in diagnosis and a substantial broadening of the criteria doctors use to describe the condition. In an umbrella review published in the British Medical Journal on Monday, researchers analysed previously published scientific reviews on whether paracetamol raised the likelihood of pregnant women having children who are diagnosed with autism or ADHD. They concluded the quality of the reviews ranged from “low to critically low”, while any apparent link between the painkiller and autism was probably explained by family genetics and other factors. Prof Shakila Thangaratinam, a consultant obstetrician and senior author on the review at the University of Liverpool, said: “Women should know that the existing evidence does not really support a link between paracetamol and autism and ADHD. “If pregnant women need to take paracetamol for fever or pain then we would say please do, particularly because high fever in pregnancy could be dangerous to the unborn baby.” Alternative painkillers such as ibuprofen are not recommended during pregnancy. The researchers examined nine systematic reviews. These included 40 observational studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy and autism, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions in children. All of the reviews reported at least a possible association between a mother’s paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism or ADHD in their children, but seven urged caution when interpreting the findings because they did not rule out other factors. Only one review included two studies that properly accounted for family genetics and other shared factors such as the mother’s pre-existing health conditions. One, published last year, found rates of autism, ADHD and intellectual disability were marginally higher in 2.4 million Swedish children whose mothers took paracetamol in pregnancy. But when the authors compared siblings who were exposed to the painkiller with those who were not, the effect disappeared. This suggests that rather than paracetamol, the mother’s genetics, underlying health conditions or other shared environmental factors were responsible. “If there’s a family history of autism and ADHD, either in the parents or the siblings, then it is likely that that is the reason a child is diagnosed rather than something the mother took in pregnancy,” said Thangaratinam. Beyond providing an overview of the evidence, the findings should reassure women who might feel guilty for taking paracetamol during pregnancy. “They might have a child that is autistic with ADHD and we really don’t want them to think it’s because of something they did in pregnancy. That’s a terrible feeling for a mother to have,” said Thangaratinam. “There isn’t anything in the current evidence that suggests mothers taking paracetamol is actually causing autism and ADHD.” Prof Dimitrios Siassakos, an honorary consultant in obstetrics at University College London, said the review confirmed what experts around the world said after Donald Trump’s comments. “Paracetamol is the safest medication to use in pregnancy, and has been used by the majority of pregnant women globally for several decades without any impact on autism and ADHD,” Siassakos said. “It is also the safest to use if there is maternal fever, whereas untreated high temperature is a risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes, including adverse foetal outcomes.

Building occupiers and investors across North America and South America expressed significantly lower growth in demand for green commercial buildings, a shift that “seems to be in response to a change in US policy focus”, according to a survey of members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Reported demand across the rest of the world also fell, albeit not as sharply. Residential and commercial buildings together accounted for 34% of global carbon emissions in 2023, according to the UN Environment Programme. The majority of those emissions came from heating, cooling and powering buildings, although about a fifth came from construction. The UN said there was a “critical need for accelerated action in the buildings sector to meet global climate goals”. However, the Rics survey suggested global construction industry professionals were experiencing slower growth in demand. Green buildings can use a range of techniques to cut their environmental impact, ranging from using materials that reduce high-carbon concrete, to cutting water use, cutting heat lost through windows, and using renewable energy. Energy efficiency improvements in particular also help to cut operating costs.

But while drones would become a “permanent fixture” of the state’s shark-control operations, the Department of Primary Industries said Queensland would continue to rely on “traditional measures like nets and drum lines”, despite evidence of their deadly impact on dolphins, whales, turtles and dugongs. Rob Adsett, the chief remote pilot at Surf Life Saving Queensland, said the drones were a “really good surveillance tool” that gave lifeguards a better view of everything at the beach. Drones were used to collect data on beach conditions and manage risks associated with sharks, with the added benefit of aiding search and rescue efforts. Drone operations ran parallel to life-saving services, he said. “So we’ll start our patrols at the start of the day when they put up the flags. And we’ll fly through to about lunchtime, and that’s mainly due to weather conditions.” The ability to see and follow sharks – and suspected sharks – in real time meant lifeguards could manage safety risks without being “overcautious”, Adsett said. “Previously if there was a shark reported, we might close the beach for an hour, but then find out that there wasn’t a shark at all.” • Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter Drones were an effective shark-control measure that offered additional safety benefits compared with shark nets, according to the Queensland government report, which monitored 10 beaches across four years. When large sharks were spotted by drone, and thought to be a risk to the public, people could be evacuated from the water. Drones also provided additional benefits, the report said, assisting with rescuing swimmers from rip currents and searching for missing people. Shark nets had a substantially higher environmental impact, with 123 non-target animals (not including non-target sharks) caught in nets across 10 beaches during the trial period. The bycatch, as it is termed, included 13 dolphins, eight whales, 45 turtles, two dugongs, dozens of rays and other fish, including many species protected under federal environment laws. About half were dead at the time of retrieval. In May, the Crisafulli government announced it would expand the use of shark nets, a position it has maintained despite more than a dozen whales becoming entangled in recent months. The state now deploys 27 nets and 383 drum lines designed to catch and kill seven target species of shark. The trial, which ran from 2020 to 2024, was part of the state government’s commitment to research to compare nonlethal alternatives with traditional shark-control measures. During the trial there were 676 shark sightings by drones, including 190 for sharks larger than 2 metres, which was significantly higher than those caught in adjacent Shark Control Program gear – 284 and 133, respectively. “Drones provide a high-definition aerial view of a wide expanse of ocean, allowing the detection of sharks in real-time, whilst having negligible impact on the environment and non-target species,” the report said. Prof Robert Harcourt, a marine ecologist at Macquarie University, said the results were “no surprise” and similar to what had been found in New South Wales. “If you’ve got clear water and sandy beaches, then drones are very effective at detecting sharks and other animals.” “Using drones, you don’t stop anything coming in, but you can see what’s there and can tell people to get out of the water – which means nobody gets hurt. “The nets are there, not to protect the beach, but to fish it,” he said. Harcourt said it was good that Queensland was trialling drones as a shark management tool, and it would be even better if the state considered switching to “smart drum lines” – where animals were caught, tagged and released – instead of lethal nets. Prof Charlie Huveneers, who leads the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders University, said while there was “no silver bullet” that could eliminate all shark-bite risk, the study added to the scientific literature reaffirming that drones should be part of the toolbox of measures. “Drones are non-lethal to targeted or bycatch species and can detect sharks enabling people to leave the water, but are not suitable in all conditions (eg strong wind, rain, low water visibility).” A Department of Primary Industries spokesperson said the use of shark-spotting drones would be expanded from 10 to 20 beaches under the 2025 to 2029 shark management plan, “becoming a permanent fixture of Shark Control Program operations, complementing traditional measures like nets and drum lines”. “While drones are a good augmentation of the program, they cannot replace core program gear such as drum lines and nets at this time,” the spokesperson said.

When large sharks were spotted by drone, and thought to be a risk to the public, people could be evacuated from the water. Drones also provided additional benefits, the report said, assisting with rescuing swimmers from rip currents and searching for missing people. Shark nets had a substantially higher environmental impact, with 123 non-target animals (not including non-target sharks) caught in nets across 10 beaches during the trial period.

The bank’s chief executive, Nuno Matos, in September announced ANZ would cut 3,500 full-time roles from its 40,000-plus workforce by September 2026. Handing down the bank’s annual results today, Matos said nearly a third of those were already gone and the majority of targeted roles will be gone by March. The bank had also stood down 1,000 consultants, he said, telling investors this morning: In order to reduce uncertainty for our people, we have moved at pace. The Finance Sector Union today warned the cuts were putting workers on edge, with national president, Wendy Streets, saying: We’re hearing from people who can’t sleep, who’ve developed panic attacks, and who dread going to work. One worker told the union: Everything is chaos – roles are changing weekly, workloads are huge, and no one knows who will still have a job next month. Matos in September said the cuts had nothing to do with AI and did not mention the technology this morning, focusing on his efforts to turn around the bank’s slow revenue growth and rising costs. Banks across Australia have been cutting jobs in 2025 but ANZ’s are the biggest by far. Read more about the cuts here: Former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has not been reappointed to the Australian War Memorial council, with Kim Beazley to remain chair. Abbott was first appointed to the council in 2019 for a three-year term, and reappointed in 2022. Veterans’ affairs minister Matt Keogh announced the changes, with Dan Keighran VC and outgoing national RSL president Greg Melick also leaving the council. Melick will be replaced by incoming national RSL president Peter Tinley. Beazley and Wing Commander (retired) Sharon Bown have both been reappointed. Keogh announced Maj Gen Wade Stothart (retired), director of the Office of Australian War Graves and Lesley Alway, chair of the Geelong Arts Centre Trust and former Opera Australia board member to join the Council. In a statement, Keogh said the new appointments would bring a “fresh, broader perspective”. Beazley said he would welcome the “insight” of the incoming members: “We thank Minster Keogh for these inspired appointments to the Memorial’s Council. Peter, Lesley and Wade bring with them a wealth of experience and expertise that will guide the Memorial in continuing to fulfil its duty to all Australians.” NSW records lowest average October rainfall since 2019 New South Wales has recorded its lowest average October rainfall since 2019 and areas with long-term rainfall deficiencies have expanded in the state’s south, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest drought statement. NSW and parts of Victoria, south-eastern Queensland and parts of southern and central Western Australia all experienced below average rainfall in the lowest 30% of all Octobers since 1900. The bureau said soil moisture deficits had expanded and intensified across much of the eastern mainland and streamflow was below average at many sites across southern Australia and central eastern Queensland, with some locations recording their lowest October streamflow on record. By contrast, much of WA, Tasmania, south and central South Australia, the northern and western Northern Territory and northern Queensland experienced above average monthly rainfall in the highest 30% of all Octobers since 1900. The bureau said long-term rainfall deficiencies in southern Victoria and Tasmania had eased in severity and extent. For the summer outlook, the BoM’s long-range forecast for December to February says above average rainfall remains likely for areas of north-east and central Queensland and parts of coastal and inland NSW, while rainfall is likely to be below average for most of WA and the northern half of the NT, and parts of south-west Tasmania. Maximum temperatures are likely to be above average for most of Australia and minimum temperatures are very likely to be above average. More from the Reserve Bank’s deputy governor: Andrew Hauser, says you don’t have to be “mad” to think more rate cuts are coming. But as noted below, Hauser reckons the economy is struggling to grow without adding to inflation. So even though Hauser’s far from being definitive about what happens to interest rates from here, the vibe is very much that mortgage holders shouldn’t hold out too much hope for further relief, if any at all. I don’t think you have to be mad or sort of fanatic to think that future rate cuts could be coming; or plausibly, perhaps at the moment, you might worry about how much remaining room there is. Hauser outlined scenarios where the RBA needed to hold from here, or where they lowered the cash rate, but no mention of the prospect for higher rates – which some economists have raised. “You can take different views about the outlook for interest rates. I’m not sure we’re far, we’re close,” he said. So these are debates, perhaps around adjustments at the margin, rather than large adjustments. Minns rejected the claim by pro-Palestine activists that allowing the rally to go ahead showed a “double standard” in NSW police’s approach to protests. He said: That would only be the case if anyone were willing to reject the fact that police have not only granted but worked with Palestine Action Group organisers for hundreds and hundreds of rallies in Sydney. Asked about the threats allegedly received by Kellie Sloane and Allegra Spender, Minns said: This is another example of what particularly women in public life have to put up with. My hat’s off to both of them, the fact that they’re prepared to stand up, put their views, put their beliefs for civic life in New South Wales. Minns does not know how high application for neo-Nazi rally reached The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said he does not know how high within NSW police an application for a neo-Nazi rally outside parliament on Saturday reached. Speaking to reporters earlier, the premier, was asked how high the application, which was automatically approved after it was not rejected within 7 days, reached after NSW police local area command initially reviewed it. Minns said: I don’t, other than, you know, obviously I take the commissioner at his word and [police minister Yasmin Catley] at her word that they weren’t aware of it. I know I wasn’t part of the review. Minns says the government is investigating whether hate speech laws, including a ban on Nazi symbols, can be expanded to include “Nazi speech, Nazi behaviours on Sydney Streets”. He also says the government is also seeking to “clarify and codify” to make sure an approved form 1 protest application does not give protesters a “free pass” when it comes to hate speech laws. RBA deputy governor says monetary policy may need to stay tight The Reserve Bank deputy governor has cast more doubt on the prospect of another rate cut, saying monetary policy may need to stay tight in an economy “boxed in by its own capacity constraints”. The RBA held its cash rate steady at 3.6% on Melbourne Cup day after inflation jumped in the September quarter, reversing a steady two-year decline. Andrew Hauser told an investment bank conference that “we find ourselves in an unusual place”, where the economy is only one year into a recovery yet is already struggling to pick up speed without adding to price pressures. Businesses in the post-pandemic economy have struggled with supply constraints, as a shortage of materials and skilled workers has crimped their potential to ramp-up activity. Hauser said normally businesses at the start of an upswing in demand would have plenty of spare capacity to increase activity without their costs rising rapidly. “But this time looks different,” he said, adding: Our central estimate suggests that demand was slightly above potential output at the time GDP growth started to pick up last year – the tightest economic backdrop to a recovery since at least the early 1980s. How much spare capacity exists in the economy will help determine whether we get further rate cuts over coming months, he said. Brisbane homeless crisis worsens ahead of Olympics, according to report The number of Queenslanders accessing homelessness services rose 20% in the last year, and Brisbane’s 2032 Olympics risks making the city’s housing crisis worse, unless action is taken immediately, according to the state’s peak housing body The city already has Australia’s tightest rental market, at just 1.1%, according to the report by Queensland Shelter and the Commonwealth-funded Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. The report reveals an 114% increase in the number of homeless households living in hotels and motel rooms paid for through the state government’s immediate housing response program, in the seven Brisbane local government areas, over the last year. Brisbane city council had by far the largest problem, with 1,901 households, more than doubling since 2024. QShelter CEO Fiona Caniglia said the games were a “unique opportunity to create a legacy we can be proud of that will make a real impact on homelessness, not in four years when it will be too late”: With possible early signs of housing pressure and displacement emerging, the race is really on now for the benefits from that additional funding to be realised. Allegra Spender says NSW police allowing neo-Nazi rally a ‘stuff-up’ amid threats against her and another MP Returning to the serious threats allegedly received by female politicians after their condemnation of Saturday’s neo-Nazi rally outside NSW parliament, Wentworth MP Allegra Spender told the ABC she is “not easily intimidated”: I was shocked when I heard [about the threats] but to be honest, let’s remind ourselves who these people are. They are extremists, and they do not represent Australian values, where we live, I think in one of the most tolerant, welcoming and open countries in the world, and I think most of us really celebrate that. Asked about how the rally was allowed to go ahead, Spender says: I think it’s very unclear so far from the New South Wales government, and also the New South Wales police really what should have happened, instead of what actually did happen. And I think it really was a stuff-up. What does it say to people, when you go: “We’ve got these new [hate speech] laws, but we’re not going to do anything if we think people are in breach of that”. So I think that’s the other big question, don’t think we’ve got an answer to. The NSW opposition confirmed that Kellie Sloane MP has allegedly received death threats after her condemnation of the rally. NSW police commissioner says actions at rally ‘despicable’ as investigation into event continues Mal Lanyon just spoke to Radio Sydney, saying police needed to investigate each group on a “case by case” basis, but said those who gathered at the neo-Nazi rally on Saturday seemed to hold an ideology backing a “white Australia policy”. He said the actions of the group were “despicable”, adding that the police were deeply investigating the 60-person rally to gather evidence that could be used in the future if NSW police needed to step in if there was a filing for another such event. The purpose of investigating the matter so thoroughly on the weekend is that we have evidence … that will obviously form [a] basis if we were to go to the supreme court and oppose [anything in the future]. … We have to work within the current legislation, we work very closely with government in terms of that legislation. Earlier this morning, Lanyon said there was an “internal communication error” that led to the rally’s approval, telling Channel Nine’s Today that NSW police had already managed more than 1,000 protests this year alone. From time to time, matters aren’t briefed up … Based on their actions on the weekend, and that’s why we’re investigating, it may well be that I would object in the supreme court to any further protest, but obviously, we need to make sure that we’ve got a case that we can go forward Federal MP Allegra Spender and NSW state MP Kellie Sloane have reported threats they received after their condemnation of Saturday’s neo-Nazi rally outside state parliament to the police. Speaking on ABC Radio Sydney earlier, the shadow health minister, Sloane, said she had began to receive dozens of “pretty hateful” messages on X on Sunday, including some “concerning enough to forward to police”, and had since deactivated her account: I think there are a lot of keyboard cowards, and I’m a pretty resilient individual, and I’m not easily bothered by these things. I don’t want them to think they’ve had any kind of win over me because I’ve exited Twitter or X … But I won’t be intimidated by them, and I won’t stop speaking up about behaviour that is racist and offends the majority of decent people in New South Wales. Asked about how the protest was able to go ahead, after the premier, Chris Minns, and the NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, put it down to a failure of communication, Sloane says: “I’d suggest it’s a complete stuff up.” The ABC has reported Spender has reported threats allegedly posted to the neo-Nazi group’s Telegram channel made in response to her condemnation of the rally – including a call for followers to “rhetorically rape” the Wentworth MP – to the Australian Federal Police. ANZ profits slide ANZ has reported a 14% decline in profits to $5.8bn, as it sacks staff and pays penalties for misconduct. The bank warned in late October it would report $1.1bn in one-off costs for the year to September, with staff redundancies accounting for more than half of the difference. It also paid a $240m Asic lawsuit over widespread misconduct and took millions more in costs after closing money-back platform Cashrewards, taking over Suncorp Bank and its investment in an Indonesian bank. If one-off significant items are excluded, ANZ’s profit was stable compared with the prior year at $6.9bn. Household savings with the bank rose $10bn and home loans picked up $17bn, while fewer borrowers fell behind on their repayments. But ANZ has seen its profit margin weaken significantly in recent years, with net interest margin sliding to 1.54% in the six months to September – the lowest in years. Prime minister says John Laws was an extraordinary figure, and there won’t be ‘another like him’ The PM also spoke about the death of veteran broadcaster John Laws, who he called “a legend,” adding: “He was such an extraordinary figure in Australian’s lives.” Albanese went on: I spoke to him many times as PM, and as leader of the opposition, and as minister going back a long, long way and you could just have a genuine conversation with him. And he was interested, he allowed you to speak. He had strong views that he would put himself, but it was a genuine conversation and I don’t think there’ll be another like him, certainly, to be on top for such a long period of time. Albanese says outrage over Joy Division shirt ‘load of nonsense’ Anthony Albanese has finally commented on the non-furore about his Joy Division T-shirt, calling it “a load of nonsense”. The prime minister did a round of radio interviews this morning to spruik the upcoming children’s social media ban, and on Nova FM was asked about his latest trip to the corporate box as he attended the Oasis concert in Sydney over the weekend. Host Ryan Fitzgerald asked: “You didn’t wear the Joy Division T-shirt, did you?”, referencing the opposition leader Sussan Ley’s recent eyebrow-raising criticism of Albanese’s clothing. The PM responded: What a load of nonsense that was, hey? … It was rather extraordinary, I’ve got to say, but a few people commented exactly that on Friday night. On the social media ban, Albanese said it was “certainly not the case” that it would further a so-called “digital ID” system. He said the change, coming in from 10 December, was about “giving [kids] back their childhood”. EV and hybrid sales soar in Australia as internal combustion cars fall below 70% market share for first time Electric car sales in Australia continue to reach new record levels, according to figures that reveal the market share for internal combustion engine vehicles fell below 70% for the first time. The latest quarterly sales data from peak motoring body the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) shows electric vehicles accounted for 9.7% of new cars sold in the three months to September, the highest proportion on record. While welcoming the figures, the Electric Vehicle Council has urged state and territory governments to reinstate axed EV subsidies to help drive the level of sales projected to be required for Australia to meet its emissions reductions goals. Read more here: High-speed testing begins on delayed Sydney metro extension High-speed testing of trains on Sydney’s Southwest Metro extension begins this week, bringing some hope for passengers forced on to replacement buses following the closure of the former heavy rail line. The NSW government says trains will now begin running at speeds of up to 100 km/h along the line, up from low-speed testing at 25 km/h, which began in April. Once completed, the line will connect the existing M1 line from Tallawong to Sydenham to former T3 line stations out to Bankstown, including Marrickville and Lakemba, with trains running every four minutes at the peak. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Transport for NSW expects the extension – originally planned to open in late 2025 – will open in September 2026, two years after the heavy rail line closed. The NSW transport minister, John Graham, has thanked residents for their patience in using replacement buses. “The T3 Bankstown line was a notorious bottleneck and a Metro will open more doors to job and education opportunities while also bringing more business to this part of Sydney.” More from Split Enz, who will head out on their first Australian tour in 20 years Split Enz aren’t just headlining the Byron Bay Bluesfest next year, they’re touring the country, too. Neil Finn said in a statement: Split Enz was my first band, my initiation into the magic of music and collaboration. It feels very special to be reuniting with that feeling and reigniting the flame. We’ll be in top form I know it, out of respect for the songs and our audience. The tour will hit Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide, with tickets on sale this week. Yasmin Catley, the NSW police minister, said a neo-Nazi rally outside state parliament on Saturday was “deeply distressing”, reaffirming that hate speech has “no place in our community”. Catley spoke to RN Breakfast after about 60 men clad in black stood outside parliament, calling for the abolition of the Jewish lobby as some speakers related antisemitic tropes. The event was authorised by New South Wales police. Catley said the event was not emblematic of free speech, saying police needed greater powers to counter such events. She told RN: They’re very tricky these neo-Nazis, they skirt around the edge of the law. The come in with a quick protest, [it] doesn’t make a lot of public ruffles, but certainly a big online presence. It’s very difficult for police to make decisions in real time, whilst all this is going on, whether or not this has crossed the line from freedom of speech to hate speech. Maria Kovacic, the shadow assistant minister to the leader of the opposition, said Liberal senator Sarah Henderson’s remarks that opposition leader Sussan Ley was “losing support” of some colleagues were not helpful, saying she remained a firm supporter of the leader. Kovacic spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying of Henderson’s remarks: Those comments aren’t helpful, and look, my view is we back in our leader. To actually suggest that a leader who is doing exactly what they said they would do, which is to listen to all colleagues … I think it’s actually unhelpful and to be frank, undisciplined. Music fans will be happy that history sometimes does repeat, with legendary Kiwi band Split Enz reuniting to headline the resurrected Byron Bay Bluesfest, AAP reports. Best known for hits including I Got You, I See Red, History Never Repeats, Message to My Girl and Six Months in A Leaky Boat, the progressive/art rock pioneers will perform their first Australian headline show in almost 20 years at the four-day Easter music festival in northern NSW. Led by original members Tim Finn, Neil Finn, Noel Crombie and Eddie Rayner, the group has reformed to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Split Enz top the rollcall of 35 artists in the 2026 festival’s first lineup announcement, which also includes Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Earth, Wind and Fire, blues treasure Buddy Guy, The Pogues, The Black Crows, Counting Crows and Sublime. Bluesfest’s return comes after the festival director, Peter Noble, previously declared 2025 would be the event’s last hurrah. Communications minister says ban will roll out in one month, saying young people should ‘take steps to prepare’ In her own statement to mark one month until the ban’s start, the communications minister, Anika Wells, heralded the national education campaign as a success. Wells said the eSafety website had recorded more than 290,000 page views from more than 200,000 users since the campaign launched three weeks ago. The minister said: We are heartened to see hundreds of thousands of Australians engaging in our education resources so they can have meaningful conversations about this significant change. Now is the time for people with under-16s in their lives to start having conversations about what the new law means for them, and talk through any concerns or worries. Young people who expect to have their accounts deactivated from 10 December can also take steps to prepare and make sure they stay connected to the people and things they love, including by backing up content and photos and exploring other ways to keep in touch. Opposition calls on government to address ‘uncertainties’ around social media ban for under-16s The federal opposition is demanding the Albanese government urgently address “uncertainties” surrounding the social media age limit ahead of its commencement in a month’s time. The world-first restrictions will start on 10 December, requiring platforms including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok to prevent under-16s from creating or holding an account. The shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said several issues remained unclear, including the final list of platforms that would be captured. The government last week added message board Reddit and video streaming platform Kick to the banned list while leaving the door open to further, delayed inclusions – such as gaming platform Roblox. McIntosh said: The intent of the ban is to protect kids online, but with this rushed, last-minute approach to adding new platforms, will the social media companies be ready in time, and what age verification mechanisms will they use? Additional platforms being added to the banned list is happening in a hasty way. Last week, the Minister said there would ‘still be room for movement’ heading into the 10 December implementation date. With urgency, the government needs to confirm the full list of platforms children can’t be on. McIntosh criticised the government’s public information campaign to promote the ban as “lacklustre”, saying parents, schools and children weren’t given enough time to prepare. Good morning, and welcome to Monday. Nick Visser here to start the week off. Here’s what’s on deck: Politicians and celebrities have paid tribute to talkback legend John Laws, who died on Sunday. Russell Crowe remembered Laws as a “wise mentor” and “mischievous mate” while Kyle Sandilands called the man known as the “Golden Tonsils” as “one of the true originals”. “He said what he thought, didn’t care who he offended, but could also show deep compassion when required. I’m devastated to have lost a mentor and a mate”, Sandilands wrote on social media. Opposition leader Sussan Ley said Australia had lost a “true pioneer of broadcasting”, saying Laws helped “shape public debate with a style that was fearless, perceptive and unmistakably his own”.

The bank\\u2019s chief executive, Nuno Matos, in September announced ANZ would cut 3,500 full-time roles from its 40,000-plus workforce by September 2026. Handing down the bank\\u2019s annual results today, Matos said nearly a third of those were already gone and the majority of targeted roles will be gone by March. The bank had also stood down 1,000 consultants, he said, telling investors this morning: In order to reduce uncertainty for our people, we have moved at pace. The Finance Sector Union today warned the cuts were putting workers on edge, with national president, Wendy Streets, saying: We\\u2019re hearing from people who can\\u2019t sleep, who\\u2019ve developed panic attacks, and who dread going to work. One worker told the union: Everything is chaos \\u2013 roles are changing weekly, workloads are huge, and no one knows who will still have a job next month. Matos in September said the cuts had nothing to do with AI and did not mention the technology this morning, focusing on his efforts to turn around the bank\\u2019s slow revenue growth and rising costs. Banks across Australia have been cutting jobs in 2025 but ANZ\\u2019s are the biggest by far. Read more about the cuts here: Former prime minister, Tony Abbott, has not been reappointed to the Australian War Memorial council, with Kim Beazley to remain chair. Abbott was first appointed to the council in 2019 for a three-year term, and reappointed in 2022. Veterans\\u2019 affairs minister Matt Keogh announced the changes, with Dan Keighran VC and outgoing national RSL president Greg Melick also leaving the council. Melick will be replaced by incoming national RSL president Peter Tinley. Beazley and Wing Commander (retired) Sharon Bown have both been reappointed. Keogh announced Maj Gen Wade Stothart (retired), director of the Office of Australian War Graves and Lesley Alway, chair of the Geelong Arts Centre Trust and former Opera Australia board member to join the Council. In a statement, Keogh said the new appointments would bring a \\u201cfresh, broader perspective\\u201d. Beazley said he would welcome the \\u201cinsight\\u201d of the incoming members: \\u201cWe thank Minster Keogh for these inspired appointments to the Memorial\\u2019s Council. Peter, Lesley and Wade bring with them a wealth of experience and expertise that will guide the Memorial in continuing to fulfil its duty to all Australians.\\u201d NSW records lowest average October rainfall since 2019 New South Wales has recorded its lowest average October rainfall since 2019 and areas with long-term rainfall deficiencies have expanded in the state\\u2019s south, according to the Bureau of Meteorology\\u2019s latest drought statement. NSW and parts of Victoria, south-eastern Queensland and parts of southern and central Western Australia all experienced below average rainfall in the lowest 30% of all Octobers since 1900. The bureau said soil moisture deficits had expanded and intensified across much of the eastern mainland and streamflow was below average at many sites across southern Australia and central eastern Queensland, with some locations recording their lowest October streamflow on record. By contrast, much of WA, Tasmania, south and central South Australia, the northern and western Northern Territory and northern Queensland experienced above average monthly rainfall in the highest 30% of all Octobers since 1900. The bureau said long-term rainfall deficiencies in southern Victoria and Tasmania had eased in severity and extent. For the summer outlook, the BoM\\u2019s long-range forecast for December to February says above average rainfall remains likely for areas of north-east and central Queensland and parts of coastal and inland NSW, while rainfall is likely to be below average for most of WA and the northern half of the NT, and parts of south-west Tasmania. Maximum temperatures are likely to be above average for most of Australia and minimum temperatures are very likely to be above average. More from the Reserve Bank\\u2019s deputy governor: Andrew Hauser, says you don\\u2019t have to be \\u201cmad\\u201d to think more rate cuts are coming. But as noted below, Hauser reckons the economy is struggling to grow without adding to inflation. So even though Hauser\\u2019s far from being definitive about what happens to interest rates from here, the vibe is very much that mortgage holders shouldn\\u2019t hold out too much hope for further relief, if any at all. I don\\u2019t think you have to be mad or sort of fanatic to think that future rate cuts could be coming; or plausibly, perhaps at the moment, you might worry about how much remaining room there is. Hauser outlined scenarios where the RBA needed to hold from here, or where they lowered the cash rate, but no mention of the prospect for higher rates \\u2013 which some economists have raised. \\u201cYou can take different views about the outlook for interest rates. I\\u2019m not sure we\\u2019re far, we\\u2019re close,\\u201d he said. So these are debates, perhaps around adjustments at the margin, rather than large adjustments. Minns rejected the claim by pro-Palestine activists that allowing the rally to go ahead showed a \\u201cdouble standard\\u201d in NSW police\\u2019s approach to protests. He said: That would only be the case if anyone were willing to reject the fact that police have not only granted but worked with Palestine Action Group organisers for hundreds and hundreds of rallies in Sydney. Asked about the threats allegedly received by Kellie Sloane and Allegra Spender, Minns said: This is another example of what particularly women in public life have to put up with. My hat\\u2019s off to both of them, the fact that they\\u2019re prepared to stand up, put their views, put their beliefs for civic life in New South Wales. Minns does not know how high application for neo-Nazi rally reached The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has said he does not know how high within NSW police an application for a neo-Nazi rally outside parliament on Saturday reached. Speaking to reporters earlier, the premier, was asked how high the application, which was automatically approved after it was not rejected within 7 days, reached after NSW police local area command initially reviewed it. Minns said: I don\\u2019t, other than, you know, obviously I take the commissioner at his word and [police minister Yasmin Catley] at her word that they weren\\u2019t aware of it. I know I wasn\\u2019t part of the review. Minns says the government is investigating whether hate speech laws, including a ban on Nazi symbols, can be expanded to include \\u201cNazi speech, Nazi behaviours on Sydney Streets\\u201d. He also says the government is also seeking to \\u201cclarify and codify\\u201d to make sure an approved form 1 protest application does not give protesters a \\u201cfree pass\\u201d when it comes to hate speech laws. RBA deputy governor says monetary policy may need to stay tight The Reserve Bank deputy governor has cast more doubt on the prospect of another rate cut, saying monetary policy may need to stay tight in an economy \\u201cboxed in by its own capacity constraints\\u201d. The RBA held its cash rate steady at 3.6% on Melbourne Cup day after inflation jumped in the September quarter, reversing a steady two-year decline. Andrew Hauser told an investment bank conference that \\u201cwe find ourselves in an unusual place\\u201d, where the economy is only one year into a recovery yet is already struggling to pick up speed without adding to price pressures. Businesses in the post-pandemic economy have struggled with supply constraints, as a shortage of materials and skilled workers has crimped their potential to ramp-up activity. Hauser said normally businesses at the start of an upswing in demand would have plenty of spare capacity to increase activity without their costs rising rapidly. \\u201cBut this time looks different,\\u201d he said, adding: Our central estimate suggests that demand was slightly above potential output at the time GDP growth started to pick up last year \\u2013 the tightest economic backdrop to a recovery since at least the early 1980s. How much spare capacity exists in the economy will help determine whether we get further rate cuts over coming months, he said. Brisbane homeless crisis worsens ahead of Olympics, according to report The number of Queenslanders accessing homelessness services rose 20% in the last year, and Brisbane\\u2019s 2032 Olympics risks making the city\\u2019s housing crisis worse, unless action is taken immediately, according to the state\\u2019s peak housing body The city already has Australia\\u2019s tightest rental market, at just 1.1%, according to the report by Queensland Shelter and the Commonwealth-funded Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. The report reveals an 114% increase in the number of homeless households living in hotels and motel rooms paid for through the state government\\u2019s immediate housing response program, in the seven Brisbane local government areas, over the last year. Brisbane city council had by far the largest problem, with 1,901 households, more than doubling since 2024. QShelter CEO Fiona Caniglia said the games were a \\u201cunique opportunity to create a legacy we can be proud of that will make a real impact on homelessness, not in four years when it will be too late\\u201d: With possible early signs of housing pressure and displacement emerging, the race is really on now for the benefits from that additional funding to be realised. Allegra Spender says NSW police allowing neo-Nazi rally a \\u2018stuff-up\\u2019 amid threats against her and another MP Returning to the serious threats allegedly received by female politicians after their condemnation of Saturday\\u2019s neo-Nazi rally outside NSW parliament, Wentworth MP Allegra Spender told the ABC she is \\u201cnot easily intimidated\\u201d: I was shocked when I heard [about the threats] but to be honest, let\\u2019s remind ourselves who these people are. They are extremists, and they do not represent Australian values, where we live, I think in one of the most tolerant, welcoming and open countries in the world, and I think most of us really celebrate that. Asked about how the rally was allowed to go ahead, Spender says: I think it\\u2019s very unclear so far from the New South Wales government, and also the New South Wales police really what should have happened, instead of what actually did happen. And I think it really was a stuff-up. What does it say to people, when you go: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got these new [hate speech] laws, but we\\u2019re not going to do anything if we think people are in breach of that\\u201d. So I think that\\u2019s the other big question, don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ve got an answer to. The NSW opposition confirmed that Kellie Sloane MP has allegedly received death threats after her condemnation of the rally. NSW police commissioner says actions at rally \\u2018despicable\\u2019 as investigation into event continues Mal Lanyon just spoke to Radio Sydney, saying police needed to investigate each group on a \\u201ccase by case\\u201d basis, but said those who gathered at the neo-Nazi rally on Saturday seemed to hold an ideology backing a \\u201cwhite Australia policy\\u201d. He said the actions of the group were \\u201cdespicable\\u201d, adding that the police were deeply investigating the 60-person rally to gather evidence that could be used in the future if NSW police needed to step in if there was a filing for another such event. The purpose of investigating the matter so thoroughly on the weekend is that we have evidence \\u2026 that will obviously form [a] basis if we were to go to the supreme court and oppose [anything in the future]. \\u2026 We have to work within the current legislation, we work very closely with government in terms of that legislation. Earlier this morning, Lanyon said there was an \\u201cinternal communication error\\u201d that led to the rally\\u2019s approval, telling Channel Nine\\u2019s Today that NSW police had already managed more than 1,000 protests this year alone. From time to time, matters aren\\u2019t briefed up \\u2026 Based on their actions on the weekend, and that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re investigating, it may well be that I would object in the supreme court to any further protest, but obviously, we need to make sure that we\\u2019ve got a case that we can go forward Federal MP Allegra Spender and NSW state MP Kellie Sloane have reported threats they received after their condemnation of Saturday\\u2019s neo-Nazi rally outside state parliament to the police. Speaking on ABC Radio Sydney earlier, the shadow health minister, Sloane, said she had began to receive dozens of \\u201cpretty hateful\\u201d messages on X on Sunday, including some \\u201cconcerning enough to forward to police\\u201d, and had since deactivated her account: I think there are a lot of keyboard cowards, and I\\u2019m a pretty resilient individual, and I\\u2019m not easily bothered by these things. I don\\u2019t want them to think they\\u2019ve had any kind of win over me because I\\u2019ve exited Twitter or X \\u2026 But I won\\u2019t be intimidated by them, and I won\\u2019t stop speaking up about behaviour that is racist and offends the majority of decent people in New South Wales. Asked about how the protest was able to go ahead, after the premier, Chris Minns, and the NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, put it down to a failure of communication, Sloane says: \\u201cI\\u2019d suggest it\\u2019s a complete stuff up.\\u201d The ABC has reported Spender has reported threats allegedly posted to the neo-Nazi group\\u2019s Telegram channel made in response to her condemnation of the rally \\u2013 including a call for followers to \\u201crhetorically rape\\u201d the Wentworth MP \\u2013 to the Australian Federal Police. ANZ profits slide ANZ has reported a 14% decline in profits to $5.8bn, as it sacks staff and pays penalties for misconduct. The bank warned in late October it would report $1.1bn in one-off costs for the year to September, with staff redundancies accounting for more than half of the difference. It also paid a $240m Asic lawsuit over widespread misconduct and took millions more in costs after closing money-back platform Cashrewards, taking over Suncorp Bank and its investment in an Indonesian bank. If one-off significant items are excluded, ANZ\\u2019s profit was stable compared with the prior year at $6.9bn. Household savings with the bank rose $10bn and home loans picked up $17bn, while fewer borrowers fell behind on their repayments. But ANZ has seen its profit margin weaken significantly in recent years, with net interest margin sliding to 1.54% in the six months to September \\u2013 the lowest in years. Prime minister says John Laws was an extraordinary figure, and there won\\u2019t be \\u2018another like him\\u2019 The PM also spoke about the death of veteran broadcaster John Laws, who he called \\u201ca legend,\\u201d adding: \\u201cHe was such an extraordinary figure in Australian\\u2019s lives.\\u201d Albanese went on: I spoke to him many times as PM, and as leader of the opposition, and as minister going back a long, long way and you could just have a genuine conversation with him. And he was interested, he allowed you to speak. He had strong views that he would put himself, but it was a genuine conversation and I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019ll be another like him, certainly, to be on top for such a long period of time. Albanese says outrage over Joy Division shirt \\u2018load of nonsense\\u2019 Anthony Albanese has finally commented on the non-furore about his Joy Division T-shirt, calling it \\u201ca load of nonsense\\u201d. The prime minister did a round of radio interviews this morning to spruik the upcoming children\\u2019s social media ban, and on Nova FM was asked about his latest trip to the corporate box as he attended the Oasis concert in Sydney over the weekend. Host Ryan Fitzgerald asked: \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t wear the Joy Division T-shirt, did you?\\u201d, referencing the opposition leader Sussan Ley\\u2019s recent eyebrow-raising criticism of Albanese\\u2019s clothing. The PM responded: What a load of nonsense that was, hey? \\u2026 It was rather extraordinary, I\\u2019ve got to say, but a few people commented exactly that on Friday night. On the social media ban, Albanese said it was \\u201ccertainly not the case\\u201d that it would further a so-called \\u201cdigital ID\\u201d system. He said the change, coming in from 10 December, was about \\u201cgiving [kids] back their childhood\\u201d. EV and hybrid sales soar in Australia as internal combustion cars fall below 70% market share for first time Electric car sales in Australia continue to reach new record levels, according to figures that reveal the market share for internal combustion engine vehicles fell below 70% for the first time. The latest quarterly sales data from peak motoring body the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) shows electric vehicles accounted for 9.7% of new cars sold in the three months to September, the highest proportion on record. While welcoming the figures, the Electric Vehicle Council has urged state and territory governments to reinstate axed EV subsidies to help drive the level of sales projected to be required for Australia to meet its emissions reductions goals.

The NSW government says trains will now begin running at speeds of up to 100 km\\/h along the line, up from low-speed testing at 25 km\\/h, which began in April. Once completed, the line will connect the existing M1 line from Tallawong to Sydenham to former T3 line stations out to Bankstown, including Marrickville and Lakemba, with trains running every four minutes at the peak. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Transport for NSW expects the extension \\u2013 originally planned to open in late 2025 \\u2013 will open in September 2026, two years after the heavy rail line closed. The NSW transport minister, John Graham, has thanked residents for their patience in using replacement buses. \\u201cThe T3 Bankstown line was a notorious bottleneck and a Metro will open more doors to job and education opportunities while also bringing more business to this part of Sydney.\\u201d More from Split Enz, who will head out on their first Australian tour in 20 years Split Enz aren\\u2019t just headlining the Byron Bay Bluesfest next year, they\\u2019re touring the country, too. Neil Finn said in a statement: Split Enz was my first band, my initiation into the magic of music and collaboration. It feels very special to be reuniting with that feeling and reigniting the flame. We\\u2019ll be in top form I know it, out of respect for the songs and our audience. The tour will hit Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide, with tickets on sale this week. Yasmin Catley, the NSW police minister, said a neo-Nazi rally outside state parliament on Saturday was \\u201cdeeply distressing\\u201d, reaffirming that hate speech has \\u201cno place in our community\\u201d. Catley spoke to RN Breakfast after about 60 men clad in black stood outside parliament, calling for the abolition of the Jewish lobby as some speakers related antisemitic tropes. The event was authorised by New South Wales police. Catley said the event was not emblematic of free speech, saying police needed greater powers to counter such events. She told RN: They\\u2019re very tricky these neo-Nazis, they skirt around the edge of the law. The come in with a quick protest, [it] doesn\\u2019t make a lot of public ruffles, but certainly a big online presence. It\\u2019s very difficult for police to make decisions in real time, whilst all this is going on, whether or not this has crossed the line from freedom of speech to hate speech. Maria Kovacic, the shadow assistant minister to the leader of the opposition, said Liberal senator Sarah Henderson\\u2019s remarks that opposition leader Sussan Ley was \\u201closing support\\u201d of some colleagues were not helpful, saying she remained a firm supporter of the leader. Kovacic spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying of Henderson\\u2019s remarks: Those comments aren\\u2019t helpful, and look, my view is we back in our leader. To actually suggest that a leader who is doing exactly what they said they would do, which is to listen to all colleagues \\u2026 I think it\\u2019s actually unhelpful and to be frank, undisciplined. Music fans will be happy that history sometimes does repeat, with legendary Kiwi band Split Enz reuniting to headline the resurrected Byron Bay Bluesfest, AAP reports. Best known for hits including I Got You, I See Red, History Never Repeats, Message to My Girl and Six Months in A Leaky Boat, the progressive\\/art rock pioneers will perform their first Australian headline show in almost 20 years at the four-day Easter music festival in northern NSW. Led by original members Tim Finn, Neil Finn, Noel Crombie and Eddie Rayner, the group has reformed to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Split Enz top the rollcall of 35 artists in the 2026 festival\\u2019s first lineup announcement, which also includes Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Earth, Wind and Fire, blues treasure Buddy Guy, The Pogues, The Black Crows, Counting Crows and Sublime. Bluesfest\\u2019s return comes after the festival director, Peter Noble, previously declared 2025 would be the event\\u2019s last hurrah. Communications minister says ban will roll out in one month, saying young people should \\u2018take steps to prepare\\u2019 In her own statement to mark one month until the ban\\u2019s start, the communications minister, Anika Wells, heralded the national education campaign as a success. Wells said the eSafety website had recorded more than 290,000 page views from more than 200,000 users since the campaign launched three weeks ago. The minister said: We are heartened to see hundreds of thousands of Australians engaging in our education resources so they can have meaningful conversations about this significant change. Now is the time for people with under-16s in their lives to start having conversations about what the new law means for them, and talk through any concerns or worries. Young people who expect to have their accounts deactivated from 10 December can also take steps to prepare and make sure they stay connected to the people and things they love, including by backing up content and photos and exploring other ways to keep in touch. Opposition calls on government to address \\u2018uncertainties\\u2019 around social media ban for under-16s The federal opposition is demanding the Albanese government urgently address \\u201cuncertainties\\u201d surrounding the social media age limit ahead of its commencement in a month\\u2019s time. The world-first restrictions will start on 10 December, requiring platforms including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, YouTube, X and TikTok to prevent under-16s from creating or holding an account. The shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, said several issues remained unclear, including the final list of platforms that would be captured. The government last week added message board Reddit and video streaming platform Kick to the banned list while leaving the door open to further, delayed inclusions \\u2013 such as gaming platform Roblox. McIntosh said: The intent of the ban is to protect kids online, but with this rushed, last-minute approach to adding new platforms, will the social media companies be ready in time, and what age verification mechanisms will they use? Additional platforms being added to the banned list is happening in a hasty way. Last week, the Minister said there would \\u2018still be room for movement\\u2019 heading into the 10 December implementation date. With urgency, the government needs to confirm the full list of platforms children can\\u2019t be on. McIntosh criticised the government\\u2019s public information campaign to promote the ban as \\u201clacklustre\\u201d, saying parents, schools and children weren\\u2019t given enough time to prepare. Good morning, and welcome to Monday. Nick Visser here to start the week off. Here\\u2019s what\\u2019s on deck: Politicians and celebrities have paid tribute to talkback legend John Laws, who died on Sunday. Russell Crowe remembered Laws as a \\u201cwise mentor\\u201d and \\u201cmischievous mate\\u201d while Kyle Sandilands called the man known as the \\u201cGolden Tonsils\\u201d as \\u201cone of the true originals\\u201d. \\u201cHe said what he thought, didn\\u2019t care who he offended, but could also show deep compassion when required. I\\u2019m devastated to have lost a mentor and a mate\\u201d, Sandilands wrote on social media. Opposition leader Sussan Ley said Australia had lost a \\u201ctrue pioneer of broadcasting\\u201d, saying Laws helped \\u201cshape public debate with a style that was fearless, perceptive and unmistakably his own\\u201d.

They will also know she was sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 33 years, and is now appealing against her conviction. Who among us hasn’t been roped into speculation about this family tragedy, the carcass of which has been picked over by pundits, amateurs and experts for years now? Over 11 long weeks, the baroque details of the trial of Erin Patterson were made immediately available to a ravenous public – including sightings of Helen Garner, Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, three of Australia’s most celebrated nonfiction writers, in the public seats of courtroom four in Morwell, Victoria. Were there several works of Australian literary nonfiction about Erin Patterson in the offing? A week after the guilty verdict was handed down, Text Publishing announced that the trio would collaborate on a book: The Mushroom Tapes. I approached this book with a fair dose of scepticism. Two major books on the trial have already been published, with more to come. Didn’t the bereft families deserve some peace? And why the rush? Did this book really need to be written in time for the Christmas sales period? A similar mixture of compulsion and resistance afflicts the authors of The Mushroom Tapes: “People say to us, you must be going. No, we answer. No. No. No.” But they do go to Morwell. “The current of the story,” they write, “has a stronger pull than we had expected.” Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein appear in the book as Helen, Chloe and Sarah. Their collaboration was conceived as a podcast and much of the book is drawn from transcripts of conversations recorded while travelling between Morwell and Melbourne. They are often on the road but never able to stay in Morwell for long. The result is a work of oral literature that has been yoked to the page; conversations between friends, conversations between women. At one point, Garner says: “If anybody wants a mandarin or a biscuit, just kindly scream out and I’ll pass it over.” In a different book, such asides might have been edited out. Here they signal an interest in the ephemera of daily life, in the nourishment required to sustain conversations, friendships and families. In both their rhythm and register, these intimate conversations recall the forms that mediated Patterson’s trial: podcasts, panel discussions, social media threads, group chats. We talk to make sense of the world – and everybody has something to say about Erin Patterson. “People are obsessed,” Hooper writes. “I run into someone at my kids’ sport, or the hairdresser, or wherever – they’re either listening to two podcasts a day and know more detail about the trial than I do, or they’re equally as strongly repulsed.” And so we find ourselves in the car to Morwell with these three intelligent women as they try to figure out what is going on in the courtroom, and how the hell Erin Patterson got there. Marriage, class, sex, money, mushrooms, women and their lives – our lives. The transcripts have been carefully edited, but locutions that convey the immediacy of live commentary are retained: “Sarah, you’re a lawyer, why has Erin decided to hold her trial in Morwell?” Sometimes it’s a bit too much like reading a podcast transcript. We stay in the present tense in the reported sections that break up the transcripts as well: “She sits in the dock at the back of the courtroom, flanked by two custody officers.” It’s as if the trial were playing on a non-stop loop. Two-podcast-a-day readers may relish the effect, but I found stasis, rather than suspense, in this unrelenting present tense. Fleeting disagreements between the authors are captured in the transcripts, and so is their equivocation: Chloe: Are we really going to drive past Erin’s house? I feel unsure about this. Sarah: For me, it’s a normal part of doing research. Helen: We’re not knocking on anyone’s door, for God’s sake. There is a lot of driving past significant sites in The Mushroom Tapes, and many such self-exonerating exchanges. The first line of Janet Malcolm’s classic study of crime journalism hangs over these conversations: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.” The authors of The Mushroom Tapes certainly know this. Often it is Hooper who voices her qualms most strongly. At one point she says: “This trial is being used for public entertainment. I feel squeamish about joining the pile-on.” And yet, here is the book. The authors give the victims of the murders their due, and they write with great compassion about the unnamed children of Erin and Simon Patterson; “they’ve been handed this bag of stones that they’ll carry for the rest of their lives,” says Krasnostein, one of the book’s most memorable lines. It is Erin Patterson, however, who captivates them. Patterson bounces, says Krasnostein, “between smallness and grandiosity”; Hooper notes that she “radiates discontent”. In an early conversation, Garner says, “It’s not that I’m big-hearted or anything, it’s just that I have this awful feeling – that could be me.” It’s quickly established that Patterson is not, in fact, much of a stranger at all; the authors write “we have discovered that the three of us are variously connected to Erin Patterson and the wider family”. After taking in Patterson’s time in the stand, Garner observes that “the gap between her and me shrank down really small”. This combination of personalisation and projection is now omnipresent in the culture. It is why I found it ultimately difficult to extract The Mushroom Tapes, for all that it is extremely readable, from the rest of the chatter about the Patterson case. Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein are an acute trio of conversational partners. Their precise, wry observations compel the reader’s attention – but so did all the loud headlines and live-crosses that kept this calamity in public view. In its formal commitment to immediacy and intimacy, not to mention its speedy publication schedule, The Mushroom Tapes reflects the moment in which it was written. I wonder whether a collaboration that had been allowed to develop more slowly might finally have relinquished the present tense, and put this case in the past. As for whether this is the last word on the Patterson case, certainly not. A series of conversations across Australia with the authors of The Mushroom Tapes sold out well before the publication date of the book. The talk about Erin Patterson, it seems, is not likely to stop soon.

Floods, storms, drought and extreme heat are among the weather conditions driving conflict and displacement, alongside slow-onset disasters such as desertification, rising sea levels and ecosystem destruction, which are threatening food and water security. In mid-2025, 117 million people were displaced by war, violence and persecution – a dire human rights crisis that the climate emergency is rapidly intensifying. The UNHCR said the climate crisis was a “risk multiplier” that exposed and compounded existing inequalities and injustices, including the impact of conflict, violence and forced displacement within and across borders. The number of countries reporting both conflict and disaster-related displacement has tripled since 2009, according to No Escape II: The Way Forward, the UNHCR’s second big report on the impacts of climate refugees released Monday. Yet fragile and conflict-affected countries hosting refugees receive only a quarter of the climate finance they need. Refugees and displaced people, often living in precarious physical and political conditions, are among the hardest hit by the climate crisis despite contributing little to its causes. In May 2024, catastrophic flooding in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul killed 181 people, causing billions of dollars of damage. The floods displaced 580,000 people, including 43,000 vulnerable refugees from Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, who were living in some of the most flood-affected areas in the region, according to UNHCR. A year earlier, Cyclone Mocha – the most destructive storm to hit Myanmar in years – made landfall in Rakhine state where 160,000 ethnic Rohingya have been living in overcrowded camps since 2012. “We had very little to begin with,” Ma Phyu Ma, 37, an internally displaced Rohingya told UN researchers. “The hut was our shelter. The boat and nets allowed us to fish. The clothes were my source of income. It is painful for me to lose everything.” In 2024, a third of all emergencies declared by UNHCR involved floods, drought, wildfires and other extreme weather events affecting people displaced by war. Three-quarters of refugees and other displaced people now live in countries facing high or extreme exposure to climate-related hazards, with repeated displacement becoming increasingly common. Chad, one of the most politically fragile and climate-vulnerable countries, hosts more than 1.4 million refugees and asylum seekers. In 2024 alone, floods forced more than 1.3 million people to flee their homes and camps – more than the previous 15 years combined. Refugees from war-torn Sudan receive less than 10 litres of water a day – far below emergency standards. Almost half the world’s displaced people are facing conflict and climate impacts in politically fragile states, including Sudan, Syria, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, Myanmar and Yemen. These countries contribute negligibly to global greenhouse gas emissions yet have limited access to climate finance and solutions needed to adapt. Without radical action to curtail climate catastrophe and help poor countries adapt, the situation is likely to get much worse, the report warns. By 2050, the hottest refugee camps could face nearly 200 days of dangerous heat stress per year, with serious risks to health and survival, with many locations becoming uninhabitable. The UNHRC is calling on climate negotiators at Cop30 in Brazil to pay attention to this largely ignored and rapidly growing population. Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said: “Funding cuts are severely limiting our ability to protect refugees and displaced families from the effects of extreme weather. If we want stability, we must invest where people are most at risk. To prevent further displacement, climate financing needs to reach the communities already living on the edge. “They cannot be left alone.

Orchardist John Galbraith, who owns and runs the farm with his wife, Erica, said he and the other local growers in Bilpin have been left scratching their heads about why, despite heavy flowering in spring, no fruit has formed. “We had what looked like good blossom but then watching the trees over the second week of October I started to realise the flowers had fallen off and there were no apples,” Galbraith said. “Instead of the petals falling off and leaving the centre of the flower (which becomes the apple), the whole flowers and stalk had fallen off and you could walk up and down the rows and couldn’t find any apples, which should be at that stage the size of a pea,” Galbraith said. About 60% of the family-run orchard is made up of apple trees, so the financial impact for the Galbraiths will be severe.

Varroa mite has “caused a significant amount of wild bee hives to be destroyed, so there’s a lack of the wild European honeybees,” a Local Land Services spokesperson said. “There was also the fact that there was flowering eucalyptus in the area, which are more attractive to the European bees that were brought in,” the spokesperson said. “Those hives would have gone for the eucalypt.” Galbraith said that local growers at the workshop had shared their hypotheses to explain the lack of fruit, but nobody could really make sense of why it was happening. “We did have a session on native bees … because of the problem with European bees who have varroa mite in them,” Galbraith said. “But we have a beekeeper that comes in who manages the hives and makes sure that there’s no mite in his hives, so I can’t see that it was terribly relevant to our situation.” Galbraith said that the orchard’s soil and plants were tested on a regular basis: “we pick up any problems and deal with them”. “The problem with not knowing what it is, is that you can’t then take action to ensure that it doesn’t happen the next year.” Apple and Pear Australia Ltd (Apal), the peak industry body, was contacted but did not wish to comment on the matter.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/09/unusual-apple-shortage-blue-mountains-orchard-why', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/8b40a41cea6d9e207e9cb99fc5cb3d27a48effa2/88_0_2310_1848/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"environment\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/unusual-apple-shortage-blue-mountains-orchard-why\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"environment\",\"sectionName\":\"Environment\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T23:00:44Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Slim pickings: what explains the unusual apple shortage in this Blue Mountains orchard?\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/environment\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/unusual-apple-shortage-blue-mountains-orchard-why\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/environment\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/unusual-apple-shortage-blue-mountains-orchard-why\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Slim pickings: what explains the unusual apple shortage in this Blue Mountains orchard?\",\"trailText\":\"Growers are reporting a difficult apple season, which is having a knock-on effect for local tourism\",\"byline\":\"Eelemarni Close-Brown\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/8b40a41cea6d9e207e9cb99fc5cb3d27a48effa2\\/88_0_2310_1848\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"At this time of year, Pine Crest Orchard in the Blue Mountains town of Bilpin would usually have about 1,000 visitors a day picking their own fruit from trees laden with apples.

It really hits a nerve', 'We could be happy together, if only we weren’t here and it wasn’t now: the tragedy of sweethearts caught up in conflict, their love overcome by others’ hate, is an old and powerful story. Trespasses, an adaptation of Louise Kennedy’s novel, written by Ailbhe Keogan, hits that nerve. A small town outside Belfast, 1975: rancour, suspicion and grief shadow every moment in the thwarted life of Cushla (Lola Petticrew), a Catholic primary-school teacher in her mid-20s who is giving up her spare time to work shifts in her brother’s pub. The priests at the school are hollering bigots, telling the children that every Protestant is an evil enemy, despite one of the kids being the son of a Catholic father and Protestant mother. Cushla takes an interest in the boy, who tends to arrive at school without a coat, and his elder brother, who shows signs of secretly sharing Cushla’s love of reading. She gives them lifts back to their house on a flag-strewn Protestant estate, at the risk of her car being pelted with bricks, and redoubles her support for the family when the dad has his legs and skull broken by vengeful neighbours. In the pub, meanwhile, the British soldiers who drink there make every evening a tense ordeal, fraught with the possibility of it ending in violence that Cushla and her brother would be powerless to stop. After closing, Cushla invariably arrives home to find her widowed mother Gina (Gillian Anderson) drowning in loneliness and gin. We know that in six months’ time, Cushla will be picking through the pub’s smoking ashes, with who knows who having been caught in the blast, and we suspect that this is the end of a sequence of events set in train when controversial local celebrity Michael Agnew (Tom Cullen) walks in. Cushla visibly loves him from that moment, before he has sat down and suavely ordered his first Jameson. Michael is a Protestant barrister who defends young Catholics, in the belief that securing them a fair trial is the best way for him to personally slow Northern Ireland’s cycle of violence – a gesture that has made him unpopular with other Protestants, but also with Catholics, who feel he legitimises the repressive judicial system. He’s a walking target, he’s married and he’s at least a decade older than Cushla, probably more like two. Embarking on an all-enveloping affair with him would be wild. With the tousled hair and tight waistcoat of a romantic hero from two centuries prior, Cullen’s Michael is a dreamy old goat. His charisma is timeless. It’s not clear how seriously Cushla (and we) should take his grand “this is the point of the series, folks” speech about how “we must find the bravery to choose freedom over fear”, delivered on a gorsey hillock away from all the urban warfare, but the sentiment is intoxicating anyway. “It’s yourself,” he says as she stands in front of him alone for the first time, in his posh city shag-pad. Van Morrison spins tastefully on his turntable two minutes later as Cushla dangles her head off the edge of the mattress, with Michael’s head in the middle. In Cullen’s hands, the guy has game, and the show wouldn’t work if he didn’t. But the bigger burden is borne by Petticrew, who is in every scene and who, if she played Cushla with less care, could let the character’s ever-changing intentions and passionate purity tip into naivety. Instead she makes the tension between Cushla’s energy and cold reality at first rousing, then heartbreaking. As it establishes itself, Trespasses seems like a collection of familiar melodramas, each borrowing from the Troubles for extra dramatic heft. We have the woman in love with a married man who isn’t honest about his home life, the teacher who goes outside her remit to help a deprived pupil, and the woman whose alcoholic mother’s final descent to oblivion will surely coincide with the one time her daughter focuses on her own happiness. It’s all Cushla, with each relationship drawing on the visceral enmity between Catholics and Protestants to rescue it from cliche. But the narrative is constructed with deceptive skill. Small moments and minor characters turn out to be crucial and, as the strands knit together, agonising ironies pile up. Strip down the show’s politics and they would be dangerously close to a hand-wringing plea for both sides to stop being as bad as each other, to end the violence, and won’t somebody please think of the children. But the Troubles give Trespasses what it needs. As individuals’ hopes and feelings are crushed in the gears of events much bigger than them, we feel that pain. • Trespasses is on Channel 4 now.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/09/trespasses-review-an-intoxicating-rousing-and-heartbreaking-love-story', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ba98f7985b1ae4a6c87833122b7ce662d684708c/861_0_7200_5760/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/trespasses-review-an-intoxicating-rousing-and-heartbreaking-love-story\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"tv-and-radio\",\"sectionName\":\"Television & radio\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T22:15:43Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Trespasses review \\u2013 an intoxicating, rousing and heartbreaking love story\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/trespasses-review-an-intoxicating-rousing-and-heartbreaking-love-story\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/trespasses-review-an-intoxicating-rousing-and-heartbreaking-love-story\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Trespasses review \\u2013 an intoxicating, rousing and heartbreaking love story\",\"trailText\":\"This adaptation of Louise Kennedy\\u2019s masterly novel, set in 70s Belfast, sees a Catholic teacher drawn into a dangerous affair with a Protestant barrister.

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we’ve had. We are just really having to fight through those hardships at the moment. “This weekend has been disastrous and disappointing for everyone. I am trying to keep my head above water and remain positive.” In a race won by Lando Norris to extend his world championship lead to 24 points from his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, Hamilton once more toiled to little effect. He had qualified in 13th and then early in the race was clipped by Carlos Sainz and shortly afterwards took floor damage when he misjudged an attempted pass on Franco Colapinto. He was forced to retire the car on lap 37, another poor result in a season in which he is sixth in the championship, 66 points behind his teammate, Charles Leclerc, and still without a podium finish. However, the seven-time champion remained resolute that he and Ferrari would find their feet as they focus on next season. “I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny,” he said. “I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can.” Meanwhile, a punchy Norris has insisted he would ignore critics “talking crap” and attempting to bring him down as he focused only on himself in attempting to close out his first world championship, after victory in Brazil. Norris won at Interlagos with a superb drive from pole position but immediately after the race hit out at questions that had been raised previously regarding his ability to fight for a title. “Just ignore everyone that talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said of his approach since he came from behind to retake the lead in the title race. He was the subject of booing at the last round in Mexico and went on to emphasise that he felt he had to cut out the noise that now surrounds the title fight with three races remaining. “There are always people out there who try to bring you down a bit. You are on the big stage and there people talk, say things, trying to influence others to have effects. Even the cheers and the not-cheers. You hear it. It’s not the nicest thing. But it is something I have evolved over the last few months to deal with. “I care a lot about people’s perspectives, and how I am portrayed and things in the media, and I probably cared too much at the beginning of the year.

He was forced to retire the car on lap 37, another poor result in a season in which he is sixth in the championship, 66 points behind his teammate, Charles Leclerc, and still without a podium finish. However, the seven-time champion remained resolute that he and Ferrari would find their feet as they focus on next season. \\u201cI believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together. I just have to keep pushing and keep giving them everything I can.\\u201d Meanwhile, a punchy Norris has insisted he would ignore critics \\u201ctalking crap\\u201d and attempting to bring him down as he focused only on himself in attempting to close out his first world championship, after victory in Brazil. Norris won at Interlagos with a superb drive from pole position but immediately after the race hit out at questions that had been raised previously regarding his ability to fight for a title. \\u201cJust ignore everyone that talks crap about you and focus on yourself,\\u201d he said of his approach since he came from behind to retake the lead in the title race. He was the subject of booing at the last round in Mexico and went on to emphasise that he felt he had to cut out the noise that now surrounds the title fight with three races remaining. \\u201cThere are always people out there who try to bring you down a bit. You are on the big stage and there people talk, say things, trying to influence others to have effects. Even the cheers and the not-cheers. You hear it. It\\u2019s not the nicest thing. But it is something I have evolved over the last few months to deal with. \\u201cI care a lot about people\\u2019s perspectives, and how I am portrayed and things in the media, and I probably cared too much at the beginning of the year. It was affecting me in not the best ways. I have learned to deal with those things better.\\u201d\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/sport\",\"pillarName\":\"Sport\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL);

I am reliably informed that is the biggest blown lead in Jacksonville’s history. Kicking a big cat when it’s down aside that is a huge win for the Texans. They keep their hopes of the playoffs alive tonight at 4-5. A division title feels very unlikely with the Colts on 8-2 but a wild card still is very possible with CJ Stroud coming back soon hopefully at quarterback. And those 8-2 Colts is where the performance of the day comes from in Berlin. Jonathan Taylor was unbelievable. The running back is keeping his name in the MVP conversation after 244 yards on 32 carries and three more touchdowns. Taylor now has 15 rushing scores in 10 games, his best in a single season is 18 so he should comfortably smash that mark. Today’s effort also has him smash through the thousand yard barrier to 1,139 total on the ground so far. Vegas have him has joint-second favourite for the individual honour. With those heady numbers swirling, I will say guten abend. Guten abend! (5-5) Carolina Panthers 7-17 New Orleans Saints (2-8) (6-3) Chicago Bears 24-20 New York Giants (2-8) (4-5) Houston Texans 36-29 Jacksonville Jaguars (5-4) (3-7) Miami Dolphins 30-13 Buffalo Bills (6-3) (4-5) Minnesota Vikings 19-27 Baltimore Ravens (4-5) (2-7) New York Jets 27-20 Cleveland Browns (2-7) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-28 New England Patriots (7-2) OH NO. Lawrence is sacked and bobbles the ball up straight into the arms of Will Anderson who runs, laughing, home for the touchdown. Of all the outcomes that was not on my bingo card. That is about as embarrassing as it gets for Jacksonville. 29-10 up with about 13 minutes remaining and they lose 36-29 to a backup QB. Horrible, horrible defeat. Texans 30-29 Jaguars 0:07, 4th quarter NFL record owning kicker Cam Little is warming up ominously on the sideline. He broke the mark last week with a 68 yarder. He may not get the chance to follow it up though after another killer penalty for the Jags. 10 yards for illegal use of hands puts them back into their own half on the 45. Can they just get out of their own way one time. No way. Never change NFL. This one looked dead in the water with the Jags up 29-10 at the start of the 4th quarter. But the Texans know their divisional rivals all too well. The sloppy PI penalty bites them on the behind and puts the cherry on the cake of an epic collapse. Davis Mills rushes for all 14 yards and the go-ahead touchdown. Can the Jags find a late field goal? Texans 24-29 Jaguars 0:41, 4th quarter Oh Jacksonville what have you done?! Or more importantly Jarrian Jones what have you done?! The defender gives up a blatant pass interference penalty to put the Texans inside the 10-yard line. Fortunately the Texans give up to bone-headed penalties of their own to give back 10 yards. They are now back to the 14-yard line with two downs to get the win. Full time: Vikings 19-27 Ravens The Ravens keep their playoff hopes rolling with a nice win as JJ McCarthy can’t pull off a miracle to save the Vikings. Texans 24-29 Jaguars 1:56, 4th quarter Wingard makes a brilliant play to break up the pass in what could have been a go-ahead touchdown. Gritty stuff from the Jags. We still have two games very much in play. I’ll boil them down. Houston Texans 24-29 Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota Vikings 19-27 Baltimore Ravens Excitingly both trailing teams are within a score and are driving. Can either pull off a comeback? After looking a little beige after the week nine explosion, this slate has developed nicely. JJ McCarthy just rips a nice run. They are on their 40-yard line with a minute to play. Full time: Dolphins 30-13 Bills, Jets 27-20 Browns, Bucs 23-28 Patriots Lowly Miami have pulled off a huge shock against Buffalo and the Jets have won two in a row. Who wudda thunk it?! Meanwhile the Patriots pull off a strong victory on the back of Henderson and Maye. Chicago continue to roar back and take the lead. Unbelievable from young Caleb Williams. The QB puts the game on his back and he rumbles 17 yards and into the end zone. From 20-10 down to 24-20 up. What a comeback. TOUCHDOWN! Buccaneers 22-28 Patriots 0:33, 4th quarter Rookie Tez Johnson makes the scoreboard look a little more flattering for the Bucs. An 11-yard strike puts them within touching distance. They fail to recover the onside kick though so that looks like curtains. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 30-13 Bills 3:17, 4th quarter The Bills defense is totally gassed. Achane takes it out left with Buffalo not able to contain the speedster. He’s home and hosed for a 35-yarder. A whopping 174 yards on 22 carries and two TDs for Achane on the day. Goes to show how poor this Bills defense is against the run. Last week Kansas City did very little on the ground and Buffalo earned a brilliant win. Today has gone a little differently. What a day for the rookie! TreVeyon Henderson with another home run in Tampa. The running back has so much time and running room he looks at his coach Mike Vrabel to ask him whether he should go in for the score or sit down to bleed the clock. He opts for the former. A 69-yard banger. 147 yards on 14 carries and two TDs. Nice. TOUCHDOWN! Bears 17-20 Giants 3:56, 4th quarter After somehow drawing a blank in the shootout for the ages last weekend in Cincinatti, Rome Odunze gleefully gets a touchdown. Caleb Williams finds the playmaker for a two-yard score. Bears are roaring back at Soldier Field. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 18-29 Jaguars 12:16, 4th quarter Jayden Higgins catches a 12-yard strike from Davis Mills and the two-pointer is converted by Nico Collins. Plenty of time still for a Houston comeback. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 23-13 Bills 3:36, 4th quarter Tight end Jackson Hawes gives the Bills a fighting chance with a 26-yard catch and score. Allen winds out to the right with a beautiful throw on the goal line. The big man finishes it off with aplomb. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 3:55, 4th quarter As is often the case, I have spoken too soon. Maye throws a pick making his day slightly less excellent. Another throw to Hollins is snatched by Tykee Smith. Tampa roll up to midfield. In the only one-score game standing we could get a thrilling finish. As the final quarters begin to wind down here are the boards: Carolina Panthers 7-17 New Orleans Saints Chicago Bears 10-20 New York Giants Houston Texans 10-29 Jacksonville Jaguars Miami Dolphins 23-6 Buffalo Bills Minnesota Vikings 13-27 Baltimore Ravens New York Jets 27-17 Cleveland Browns Tampa Bay Buccaneers 16-21 New England Patriots Some close ones out there, not very though and maybe not for long in Tampa. The Pats are on the five-yard line after a 54-yard bomb to Mack Hollins. What a throw from Drake Maye. The QB is 16/29 for 270 yards, two scores and no picks. Excellent day at the office thus far. Game over. De’Von Achane torches this knackered Bills defense. He races clear with defenders flailing in his wake for a monster 59-yard touchdown. Even Allen can’t save the Bills from here, right? Fumble! Dolphins 16-6 Bills 7:51, 4th quarter Josh Allen puts his cape on, the superhero act doesn’t exactly go to plan though. On a run up the middle the QB is caught out by Jordyn Brooks. The Dolphin punches the ball out. Minkah Fitzpatrick gobbles it up. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 7-17 Saints 10:20, 4th quarter Shough hits his tight end Juwan Johnson for a 30-yard strike to give the Saints a healthy lead in the final quarter. An upset in the making. Frustrating for my fantasy team as I benched him. Ouch. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 24-17 Browns 14:12, 4th quarter Justin Fields dumps it off to Breece Hall. The running back does the rest. Hall scampers for a 42-yard score. Who needs generational talents on defense anyway? Well against an equally bad team you don’t anyway. The Jets have not missed Williams and Gardner much so far. Pick! Dolphins 16-6 Bills 8:55, 4th quarter Maybe the comeback is on! Maxwell Hairston picks off Tua Tagovailoa. A brilliant play puts the Bills quickly back on offense on their 24-yard line. If Miami can hold on this would be massive. They have beaten Buffalo once in their past 15 attempts and have lost the last seven in succession. Large if with Allen back o the ball. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 0:58, 3rd quarter Big stop for the Bucs defense. The Pats go for it on 4th down. Drake Maye goes to his talisman Diggs but he can’t reel it in. Turnover on downs. Baker Mayfield has a shot to retake the lead now. He takes over at midfield. Is the comeback on? Maybe. Josh Allen leads a 98-yard drive with a 35-yard finisher to Keon Coleman. That was three passes in succession for more than 20 yards that kept Miami at sixes and sevens. (Sorry for saying six and seven). On the two pointer Khalil Shakir catches the short pass but can’t make it into the end zone. That keeps it to a two-score game for Miami. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 4:12, 3rd quarter Neil Reynolds on Sky Sports with an absolute nugget for the ages. The touchdown scorer Tez Johnson is Bo Nix’s adopted brother. The Nix family adopted Johnson at the age of 15. How utterly lovely. How is he not in Denver though? We need brothers reuinted. “Great offense beats great defense,” says Tony Romo. It sure does. Tez Johnson makes a wonderful grab to snap up a 10-yard score. Game on! TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 10-19 Ravens 8:02, 3rd quarter Justice Hill bangs in the one-yard score to give the Ravens a healthy lead. JJ McCarthy needs to step it up here. The young quarterback is 10/17 for 134 yards with no touchdowns and two picks. Struggling. Pick! Dolphins 16-0 Bills 5:59, 3rd quarter I think I may have spoken to soon. It appears to just not be Buffalo’s day. Josh Allen throws an ugly pick in the end zone. Ifeatu Melifonwu says thank you very, very much. Dolphins 16-0 Bills 6:39, 3rd quarter Buffalo enter the red zone for the first time in this game. I wonder when the last time a team prevented Josh Allen from making it inside the 20-yard line for an entire half? On that note Allen quickly takes them to 1st &amp; Goal with a keeper up the middle. Six first downs on this drive v four in the first half. Dolphins 16-0 Bills 10:09, 3rd quarter Josh Allen is quite special too. The quarterback has the ball for an absolute age as he runs backwards and loops around from left to right. He points to Curtis Samuel telling him where to be, the receiver says “Yessir” and is on hand to convert Buffalo’s first third down of the day. They then convert another to keep the wheels moving. That improvisation from Allen could be the spark the Bills need. TOUCHDOWN! Bears 7-17 Giants 12:17, 3rd quarter Jaxson Dart scrambles left and looks for the end zone. The rookie finds it for a 24-yard rushing touchdown. This kid is special. Pick! Vikings 10-9 Ravens 12:41, 3rd quarter Strange looking interception for JJ McCarthy as he throws the bomb to Justin Jefferson but his receiver falls over. All alone Marlon Humphrey cannot believe his luck. He is looking around in disbelief as he wanders back up field from the end zone. Weird. TreVeyon Henderson rips a 55-yard home run. The rookie running back showcases his elite speed to shoot through the gap in the line. And he is OUTTA HERE. Superb. The Pats score with the final play of the half then hit again quickly upon resuming. The Bucs will be wondering what has hit them. Pick! Texans 10-20 Jaguars 0:17, 2nd quarter Unreal interception in Houston. Derek Stingley Jr reaches out in front of Trammell and pulls off a one-handed pick. Get this man on offense now. Jets 17-14 Browns 0:55, 2nd quarter Justin Fields is having another statistically sad day. But who cares really as the Jets special teams have them leading, for now at least. The quarterback is 3/6 for a net loss of five yards and one interception. The Browns defense is nasty, the Jets offense is nastier. Myles Garret snaffles his second sack of the day to force the punt. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 10-20 Jaguars 1:19, 2nd quarter Just as I put the scores out the Texans muck it all up. Woody Marks finds the edge out left and saunters home for a crucial score before the break. So with five games in for a break here are the scores on the boards. There are 33 seconds left in Miami, Dalton Kincaid with a bad drop there. Tough in the rain though. Bills let the clock die and are in a big hole. Carolina Panthers 7-10 New Orleans Saints Chicago Bears 7-10 New York Giants Houston Texans 3-20 Jacksonville Jaguars Miami Dolphins 16-0 Buffalo Bills Minnesota Vikings 10-9 Baltimore Ravens New York Jets 17-14 Cleveland Browns Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10-14 New England Patriots A punishing 7min 16sec drive from the Patriots arrives at the goal line. Mike Vrabel gets cute by wasting the clock and purposefully running the ball without the intention of scoring on first down. On second they go for it and get stuffed. Slightly embarrassing. On the third attempt Henderson is inches from breaking the plain but the Bucs stay strong. If the Bucs get the stop here on 4th down that would be huge. They pass it. Red zone specialist Stefon Diggs makes the grab under extreme pressure. Amazing play to get his feet down as he falls out on to the sideline. He just scrapes them on the turf and holds on to the ball for the score. What a play. Not how the Patriots wanted to take the lead into half-time but what a relief for New England. So unlucky for Tampa. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 14-14 Browns 10:34, 2nd quarter “A gorgeous throw from Dillon Gabriel,” says the commentator in New Jersey. He isn’t wrong. Gabriel levels it up with a dime to Jerry Jeudy in the end zone. The receiver makes the diving grab for a 22-yard set of six points. Dolphins 13-0 Bills 9:13, 2nd quarter A comedy of errors unfolding in Miami. James Cook coughs up an absolute nightmare of a fumble. He lets go of it and the ball bounces end over end toward the end zone, Miami players keep diving and missing until one eventually just manages to snag it. Josh Allen looks very annoyed. The Dolphins take over on their five-yard line. Pick! Vikings 10-3 Ravens 10:33, 2nd quarter Malaki Starks makes his first NFL interception. It is an absolute beauty, he absolutely posterises Justin Jefferson with a leap up and ahead of him to make the grab. The Ravens take over at Baltimore’s 22-yard line. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 0-17 Jaguars 11:40, 2nd quarter Parker Washington is playing a blinder in Houston! He made the toe-tapper for Jacksonville’s first score and has just returned a punt 72 yards for another touchdown. Single handedly demolishing the Texans. It looks over already with Davis Mills still in at quarterback over the injured CJ Stroud. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 7-10 Saints 9:21, 2nd quarter No Rashid Shaheed, no problem. Chris Olave is pretty good at tearing the roof off the defense too apparently. A lovely stutter move creates the room for Olave to catch from Tyler Shough, who is then off to the races up the right sideline for a 62-yard bomb. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 13-0 Bills 14:52, 2nd quarter As scorelines go this one is very unexpected. Tua Tagovailoa gives the Dolphins a two-score lead with a fantastic throw to Jaylen Waddle in the end zone. The speedster cruises by the defender and is right on time to catch the 38-yard score. Extra point is no good. Kyle Williams breaks the top off the Bucs defense with a monster 72-yard touchdown. Drake Maye slings it to the open Williams who beats his man and is off like a rocket up the right sideline. A perfect throw from Maye to the receiver perfectly in stride. Huge smile from Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel. He knows his quarterback is special. Special teams are truly special for the Jets. Not happy with just a kick-off return, Isaiah Williams returns a punt for a 74-yard score. Unreal. J-E-T-S, JETS, JETS, JETS! TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 7-0 Bills A surprise early lead for Miami (2-7) against AFC East rivals Buffalo (6-2), Malik Washington with the score. Latest scores: Panthers 7-3 Saints Bears 7-0 Giants Texans 0-10 Jaguars Dolphins 0-0 Bills Vikings 7-3 Ravens Jets 7-7 Browns Buccaneers 7-0 Patriots TOUCHDOWN! The first score of the 6pm (GMT) games comes in Tampa, Emeka Agbuka putting the Buccaneers up on the Patriots in the Tom Brady classic. Right, here’s what we’ve got coming up: (5-4) Carolina Panthers v New Orleans Saints (1-8) (5-3) Chicago Bears v New York Giants (2-7) (3-5) Houston Texans v Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3) (2-7) Miami Dolphins v Buffalo Bills (6-2) (4-4) Minnesota Vikings v Baltimore Ravens (3-5) (1-7) New York Jets v Cleveland Browns (2-6) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers v New England Patriots (7-2) Jonathan Taylor speaking on Sky Sports after his 286-yard day: “We understood the assignment!” Six more for Taylor on first down and now it’s all about ball security, at least so you think. Taylor puts it beyong doubt as he goes untouched into the end zone to win it as Warren clears the way. Colts 25-25 Falcons 4:44, OT Taylor makes seven hard yards on first down but can’t make any more on second but then finds a gap on third down. First down and Taylor has more than 250 all purpose yards. Colts into the redzone. Colts 25-25 Falcons 6:44, OT Tyler Warren makes a huge play! Lovely touch on the throw from Jones and the Colts are now probably in good enough position to win this, down to the Falcons’ 22. Colts 25-25 Falcons 7:29, OT It’s not a great kick and Downs manages to get a few extra yards. Jones will have nice field position to start and they now only need a field goal. Colts 25-25 Falcons 8:14, OT The Falcons cannot get anything going and facing third and long, again, Penix is sacked by Zaire Franklin. They will have to punt. Colts 25-25 Falcons 9:06, OT Penix faces pressure on third down and with the ball harmlessly hitting the turf, but there’s a flag. New set of downs. Lot’s of confusion there as the Falcons opt to let the clock run out for a juicy bit of overtime. Berlin with an absolute banger! Danke schöne! It’s good! Colts 25-25 Falcons 0:25, 4th quarter Jones is sacked again bringing up another 3rd down. The Colts dump off a short pass to move the kicker closer to tie this up. Badgley has missed two already today. I can’t look. It’s … GOOD! 44-yard strike levels it. “They love their kickers over here,” quips Kurt Warner. Yeah, we sure love it when they kick the ball in Europe. Colts 22-25 Falcons 1:11, 4th quarter Atlanta’s pass rush wins again on the very next play. A sixth sack of Jones rocks the Colts back to 3rd &amp; 21. The QB is forced to scramble with no receivers open and he is so, so close to getting it. 4th &amp; 2, pressure, Jones lofts it to Warren who is under even more pressure from Bolin, but makes the catch to move the chains. Brilliant. Colts 22-25 Falcons 1:32, 4th quarter Ameer Abdullah comes up huge for the Colts on the kick return. The speedster races up to midfield giving Jones excellent position to go with the handy amount of clock. After all the excitement, Tyler Warren may have just fumbled. Indy await the referees call nervously. INCOMPLETE. 2nd &amp; 10 to go with one timeout in hand. And they keep slicing and dicing. Tyler Allgeier gets a hat-trick of hand offs that work perfectly. He just keeps banging until he is stopped on the goal line. They keep it with him for the one-yard score. Drake London snatches up the two-point conversion too. You could almost say Atlanta scored a bit too quickly there. Jones has plenty of time to work with. Colts 22-17 Falcons 2:00, 4th quarter What a thriller for Berlin’s footballing public. Two minutes remain. With the game on the line Atlanta are finally finding some offensive fluency. They slice and dice the Colts, with a heady brew of run and pass, up to Indy’s 32-yard line. They are in position to win, but can Penix and company deliver? What on Earth!? Jonathan Taylor runs 83 yards for a touchdown to give Indy the lead!!! And it is an incredible one. The back is trapped at the line of scrimmage and I mean pinned up against his linemen but he keeps those giant legs churning to bust out to the left into fresh air. He just keeps running and running and running and running and touchdown! That was set up the Colts say anything you can do to the Falcons D by forcing another punt. Bijan Robinson had them moving until Penix took over on 3rd down. The QB throws long and misses. Not even close, seven failures on 3rd down. It’s good! Colts 16-17 Falcons 9:00, 4th quarter This Falcons defense is playing out of their minds. A five-yard delay of game penalty knocks some air out of the Indy balloon, and the Colts elect to just buy some yards back with a short pass on 2nd down. On 3rd and long Jones steps up and out of the pocket but is chased down by Brandon Dorlus. That is five sacks now for the Falcons. Mike Badgley bangs in the 34-yarder but it is Atlanta who are celebrating another big stop in the red zone. Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:29, 4th quarter The Colts immediately revert to Taylor, smart thinking as he hits an 18-yard run up the right then an eight-yard scamper to Atlanta’s 25-yard line. On the third down … Jones GETS IT on the QB keeper. Phew. 14th try is the charm after all. Red zone time. Colts 13-17 Falcons 13:56, 4th quarter Three and out for Atlanta. It is all about Sauce Gardner. The corner is all over the field as he stops two passing plays, the second of which could have been a pass interference call as he smashes into Darnell Mooney. A real bully move that gives the receiver no chance of making the grab. No call though, so well played, Sauce. Can I shock you? On the resulting third down the Colts get to Penix so he throws it in the trash. Punt. 13 failures between them on 3rd down now. 13! Outside of two minutes in the first quarter when 21 points ran up the scoreboard these defenses have been superb. Colts 13-17 Falcons 0:47, 3rd quarter Another third down, another failure. What else were you expecting? Jones has no one open so he tries to scramble for it but comes up two yards short. The Colts gamble again as a field goal is fairly useless to them. Taylor is stopped short on the run. Atlanta were ready for it that time. This defense are doing a phenomenal job at stopping Indy. Pittsburgh needed splashy turnovers last week to best them, pure grit and gristle for the Falcons so far. Colts 13-17 Falcons 4:03, 3rd quarter And the wait continues for a third down conversion. Taylor comes up just shy so Indy gamble. One yard for the 1st and of course their bell cow moves the chains this time. 19 yards remain for the Colts. Colts 13-17 Falcons 5:08, 3rd quarter Indy’s version of protecting the QB appears to be not calling passing plays on this drive. Six plays, six runs. Taylor carries them to midfield only for them to call the screen pass to Tyler Warren who scampers out to the left for 24 yards. About another 24 to go for the go-ahead score. Colts 13-17 Falcons 8:38, 3rd quarter Colts take over and will be hoping to do a better job of protecting the quarterback. The Falcons have sacked Jones four times. Ouch. Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:19, 3rd quarter Drake London 1-1 Sauce Gardner. WOW! Gardner almost picks off a Penix throw to London. The corner jumps the route perfectly to put him in prime position for an easy interception. But Butter fingers strike and he drops it. Still, he breaks up the play and the Falcons must punt. And we continue to wait for one of these two to convert a third down. Both are 0-5. Sort it out! Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:19, 3rd quarter The Colts were cruising down the field there, until they weren’t. Daniel Jones is monstered by Atlanta’s pass rush not once but twice. Firstly Jones is pressured into fumbling but he manages to recover setting up a long 3rd down. He fails on his second try as James Pearce forces the fumble after a huge sack. Atlanta are causing serious problems, they take over at midfield. Colts 13-17 Falcons 12:19, 3rd quarter Excellent field position for Indy. They set up show on Atlanta’s 44-yard line after a 50-yard return by Ashton Dulin. Their position gets even better on the next play as Jonathan Taylor breaks off a 24-yard run after a short catch. It’s good! Colts 13-17 Falcons 12:26, 3rd quarter And that is the second touchdown Pitts should have had on another missed third down. Only this time it is all on the quarterback. He throws deep into the left corner of the end zone with his tight end on his mark to make the catch. Penix’s throw is slow and short, with no arc on the ball it bonks Jaylon Jones on the helmet before reaching Pitts and pops harmlessly out of play. Zane Gonzalez makes the 43-yard kick. Colts 13-14 Falcons 12:54, 3rd quarter Atlanta start the second half on offense and are already deep into enemy territory after a 25-yard grab from Kyle Pitts. Bijan Robinson then rumbles for another first down. A missed tackle at the line of scrimmage sets up the run to Indy’s 30-yard line. Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time It turns out a lot of people have heard of THE Kid Laroi to give him his full title. Stay with Justin Bieber has 3,714,698,060 streams on Spotify. Nearly four billion, what’s that translate to as income, hmmm … 37 quid a month? Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time Despite a few offensive fireworks, the defenses have shown some serious muscle. Neither team have converted a third down yet. Three failures for Atlanta and four for Indy. Anyone ever heard of this bloke Kid Laroi doing the half-time show? I use the word bloke advisedly as he hails from Australia. Google tells me has done a song with Justin Bieber. I think that might be this second tune. Certainly better than the opener. Apologies, Mr Laroi. Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time Interception! Jones takes a huge sack for a 10-yard loss and it looks like Indy are going to run the clock out. Only they dial up the deep pass and it goes wrong. Jones massively underthrows his receiver and is picked off by Jessie Bates. Atlanta have some time but not enough to extend their lead. Indy avoid what could have been an ugly own goal. Drake London 1-0 Sauce Gardner. The cornerback slips as London has an easy catch to move the chains. Not that he would have broken it up even if he had stayed vertical. For the touchdown London makes a 16-yard grab with the ball flying over his head, the red zone monster sticks his mitts out and that is all she wrote. Germaine Pratt never had a chance in coverage, Gardner had scampered off with Kyle Pitts. London has 72 yards on four receptions so far. Colts 13-7 Falcons 6:57, 2nd quarter The defenses are settling down into their assignments now. The combatants trade punts on a lesser-spotted three and out for Indianapolis. Atlanta take over at their 45-yard line, well placed to strike back before half-time. The Colts defense will have something to say about that though. They have done a great job of confusing Penix Jr so far by faking pressure at the line of scrimmage then dropping back into coverage. It’s no good! Colts 13-7 Falcons 10:40, 2nd quarter Mike Badgley is having a shocker. He misses the mark after a lucky escape for Jones who fumbles but is saved by the ball going out of bounds. The QB tries a scramble and upon impact from a defender sheds the rock but the Falcons just cannot get the ball under control. The drive loses steam and so out comes the kicker. The 53-yard effort comes up painfully short. Four points left out on the field already today for Indy. Colts 13-7 Falcons 12:45, 2nd quarter Pierce is involved again as he moves the Colts up to midfield with a 26-yard grab. Tyler Warren then provides the safety net for Jones who was inches from taking a huge sack. The rookie makes a punishing run after the catch through two defenders and keeps the chains moving in the process. Indi are moving the ball with ease so far. Colts 13-7 Falcons 15:00, 2nd quarter The opening quarter winds to a close with the Colts fighting out from their two-yard line to the 26. An excellent punt pinned them back but they are coming again. Colts 13-7 Falcons 4:36, 1st quarter And our commentary team kindly informs us that Pierce’s brother played basketball in Germany. So him scoring today was meant to be I suppose. We have a first glimpse of Sauce Garnder then as he attempts a peanut punch, no bueno sadly. One minute later and Indianapolis have retaken the lead. End-to-end stuff. Alec Pierce catches an unbelievable home-run shot from Daniel Jones for a 37-yard touchdown. The receiver is sandwiched between two defenders in the end zone but makes a soaring catch thanks to a pass that perfectly finds its mark between them. Before that Jonathan Taylor put his QB in range with a supremely feisty run for 28 yards, actually carrying a chasing defender at one point. What a game we have already here. Penix Jr puts the fumble behind him by marching his Falcons down the field for a score of their own. Drake London makes some chunky receptions to put them in the red zone then the seas part for Tyler Allgeier to saunter on to the goal line through the heart of the field for 13 yards. The running back finishes it off for a one-yard touchdown of his own. Advantage Atlanta. Did Kyle Pitts just drop a touchdown? The tight end drops a clanger, he was very open but the ball just swishes through his hands. That play rather sums up the first round pick’s career to date. So far, so disappointing but it only gets worse for the Falcons as they cough the ball back to the Colts on the 23-yard line. Michael Penix Jr is hunted down and can’t keep hold of the ball. A nifty 22-yard run from Ashton Dulin sets Jonathan Taylor up to roll in for the score on the following play. Kicker Michael Badgley skews the extra point wide. Oops. Colts 0-0 Falcons 10:51, 1st quarter And the drama keeps coming as the Colts go for it on 4th down. The gamble fails to pay off as Josh Downs cannot reel in a fastball from Jones. On the play before the turnover on downs Jessie Bates put a huge hit on tight end Mo Alie-Cox. The Falcons have come out fighting on defense as they try and snap their three-game losing streak. Next up Sauce Garner’s debut! Colts 0-0 Falcons 13:30, 1st quarter Here we go! And we have early drama after Jonathan Taylor catches a screen pass, sweeps out for 15 yards to the right then fumbles … only for his center to save his bacon with the recovery. Colts are in Falcons territory already. Not to be outdone the singer belting out the Star Spangled Banner has some of the largest shoulder pads you are ever likely to see. Loving the sartorial choices today. We are almost underway after a choral number for the German anthem. Classy. As sparkly jackets go that is an absolute belter from Katarina Witt on the coin toss. Did the referee say she was an Olympic tennis champion? Figure skating was Witt’s game I believe. A slight fluff from Sky Sports there as we hear “who won the toss?” from the presenter with an unfortunately hot mic. Well, the Colts have won the toss and have elected to receive. Daniel Jones and company will be setting up shortly. Will the QB bounce back after a rough one in Pittsburgh? And for afters the jumbo package starting at 12pm CST/1pm EST/6pm GMT (home teams listed first) is as follows: (5-4) Carolina Panthers v New Orleans Saints (1-8) (5-3) Chicago Bears v New York Giants (2-7) (3-5) Houston Texans v Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3) (2-7) Miami Dolphins v Buffalo Bills (6-2) (4-4) Minnesota Vikings v Baltimore Ravens (3-5) (1-7) New York Jets v Cleveland Browns (2-6) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers v New England Patriots (7-2) What a feast. I’m planting my flag on Minnesota and Baltimore playing out the game of the day. Guten tag, fussball fans. Wie gehts? Alles klar I hope on this fine early start to week 10 coming straight outta Deutschland. The Olympiastadion in Berlin to be exact where at 8.30am CST/9.30am EST and 2.30pm GMT the mighty Indianapolis Colts (7-2) take on the Atlanta Falcons (3-5). The fifth game played on German soil and the first in the nation’s capital. The news hounds among you may have picked up on the Colts being involved in some rather large business on trade deadline day. So what looked like an intriguing one between a playoff contender and a team fighting to turn things around has been turned up several notches by Indianapolis trading for star cornerback Sauce Gardner. Yes, on Tuesday they engaged in some rather punchy retail therapy to shake off the sadness of losing to Pittsburgh. The Colts dispensed two future first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell in exchange for the highest paid corner in the NFL. Indianapolis are all in on the Super Bowl and handily Gardner has cleared concussion protocol for a first appearance since week seven today to aid that endeavour. His first assignment will most likely be tracking Drake London. As head-to-heads go this could be a classic. Atlanta’s premier pass catcher starts in good form after nabbing three touchdowns last week with more than 100 yards in three of his past four games. So no pressure, Sauce. But the $120m man will likely back himself. A good on good matchup as they say.

I am reliably informed that is the biggest blown lead in Jacksonville\\u2019s history. Kicking a big cat when it\\u2019s down aside that is a huge win for the Texans. They keep their hopes of the playoffs alive tonight at 4-5. A division title feels very unlikely with the Colts on 8-2 but a wild card still is very possible with CJ Stroud coming back soon hopefully at quarterback. And those 8-2 Colts is where the performance of the day comes from in Berlin. Jonathan Taylor was unbelievable. The running back is keeping his name in the MVP conversation after 244 yards on 32 carries and three more touchdowns. Taylor now has 15 rushing scores in 10 games, his best in a single season is 18 so he should comfortably smash that mark. Today\\u2019s effort also has him smash through the thousand yard barrier to 1,139 total on the ground so far. Vegas have him has joint-second favourite for the individual honour. With those heady numbers swirling, I will say guten abend. Guten abend! (5-5) Carolina Panthers 7-17 New Orleans Saints (2-8) (6-3) Chicago Bears 24-20 New York Giants (2-8) (4-5) Houston Texans 36-29 Jacksonville Jaguars (5-4) (3-7) Miami Dolphins 30-13 Buffalo Bills (6-3) (4-5) Minnesota Vikings 19-27 Baltimore Ravens (4-5) (2-7) New York Jets 27-20 Cleveland Browns (2-7) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-28 New England Patriots (7-2) OH NO. Lawrence is sacked and bobbles the ball up straight into the arms of Will Anderson who runs, laughing, home for the touchdown. Of all the outcomes that was not on my bingo card. That is about as embarrassing as it gets for Jacksonville. 29-10 up with about 13 minutes remaining and they lose 36-29 to a backup QB. Horrible, horrible defeat. Texans 30-29 Jaguars 0:07, 4th quarter NFL record owning kicker Cam Little is warming up ominously on the sideline. He broke the mark last week with a 68 yarder. He may not get the chance to follow it up though after another killer penalty for the Jags. 10 yards for illegal use of hands puts them back into their own half on the 45. Can they just get out of their own way one time. No way. Never change NFL. This one looked dead in the water with the Jags up 29-10 at the start of the 4th quarter. But the Texans know their divisional rivals all too well. The sloppy PI penalty bites them on the behind and puts the cherry on the cake of an epic collapse. Davis Mills rushes for all 14 yards and the go-ahead touchdown. Can the Jags find a late field goal? Texans 24-29 Jaguars 0:41, 4th quarter Oh Jacksonville what have you done?! Or more importantly Jarrian Jones what have you done?! The defender gives up a blatant pass interference penalty to put the Texans inside the 10-yard line. Fortunately the Texans give up to bone-headed penalties of their own to give back 10 yards. They are now back to the 14-yard line with two downs to get the win. Full time: Vikings 19-27 Ravens The Ravens keep their playoff hopes rolling with a nice win as JJ McCarthy can\\u2019t pull off a miracle to save the Vikings. Texans 24-29 Jaguars 1:56, 4th quarter Wingard makes a brilliant play to break up the pass in what could have been a go-ahead touchdown. Gritty stuff from the Jags. We still have two games very much in play. I\\u2019ll boil them down. Houston Texans 24-29 Jacksonville Jaguars Minnesota Vikings 19-27 Baltimore Ravens Excitingly both trailing teams are within a score and are driving. Can either pull off a comeback? After looking a little beige after the week nine explosion, this slate has developed nicely. JJ McCarthy just rips a nice run. They are on their 40-yard line with a minute to play. Full time: Dolphins 30-13 Bills, Jets 27-20 Browns, Bucs 23-28 Patriots Lowly Miami have pulled off a huge shock against Buffalo and the Jets have won two in a row. Who wudda thunk it?! Meanwhile the Patriots pull off a strong victory on the back of Henderson and Maye. Chicago continue to roar back and take the lead. Unbelievable from young Caleb Williams. The QB puts the game on his back and he rumbles 17 yards and into the end zone. From 20-10 down to 24-20 up. What a comeback. TOUCHDOWN! Buccaneers 22-28 Patriots 0:33, 4th quarter Rookie Tez Johnson makes the scoreboard look a little more flattering for the Bucs. An 11-yard strike puts them within touching distance. They fail to recover the onside kick though so that looks like curtains. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 30-13 Bills 3:17, 4th quarter The Bills defense is totally gassed. Achane takes it out left with Buffalo not able to contain the speedster. He\\u2019s home and hosed for a 35-yarder. A whopping 174 yards on 22 carries and two TDs for Achane on the day. Goes to show how poor this Bills defense is against the run. Last week Kansas City did very little on the ground and Buffalo earned a brilliant win. Today has gone a little differently. What a day for the rookie! TreVeyon Henderson with another home run in Tampa. The running back has so much time and running room he looks at his coach Mike Vrabel to ask him whether he should go in for the score or sit down to bleed the clock. He opts for the former. A 69-yard banger. 147 yards on 14 carries and two TDs. Nice. TOUCHDOWN! Bears 17-20 Giants 3:56, 4th quarter After somehow drawing a blank in the shootout for the ages last weekend in Cincinatti, Rome Odunze gleefully gets a touchdown. Caleb Williams finds the playmaker for a two-yard score. Bears are roaring back at Soldier Field. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 18-29 Jaguars 12:16, 4th quarter Jayden Higgins catches a 12-yard strike from Davis Mills and the two-pointer is converted by Nico Collins. Plenty of time still for a Houston comeback. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 23-13 Bills 3:36, 4th quarter Tight end Jackson Hawes gives the Bills a fighting chance with a 26-yard catch and score. Allen winds out to the right with a beautiful throw on the goal line. The big man finishes it off with aplomb. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 3:55, 4th quarter As is often the case, I have spoken too soon. Maye throws a pick making his day slightly less excellent. Another throw to Hollins is snatched by Tykee Smith. Tampa roll up to midfield. In the only one-score game standing we could get a thrilling finish. As the final quarters begin to wind down here are the boards: Carolina Panthers 7-17 New Orleans Saints Chicago Bears 10-20 New York Giants Houston Texans 10-29 Jacksonville Jaguars Miami Dolphins 23-6 Buffalo Bills Minnesota Vikings 13-27 Baltimore Ravens New York Jets 27-17 Cleveland Browns Tampa Bay Buccaneers 16-21 New England Patriots Some close ones out there, not very though and maybe not for long in Tampa. The Pats are on the five-yard line after a 54-yard bomb to Mack Hollins. What a throw from Drake Maye. The QB is 16\\/29 for 270 yards, two scores and no picks. Excellent day at the office thus far. Game over. De\\u2019Von Achane torches this knackered Bills defense. He races clear with defenders flailing in his wake for a monster 59-yard touchdown. Even Allen can\\u2019t save the Bills from here, right? Fumble! Dolphins 16-6 Bills 7:51, 4th quarter Josh Allen puts his cape on, the superhero act doesn\\u2019t exactly go to plan though. On a run up the middle the QB is caught out by Jordyn Brooks. The Dolphin punches the ball out. Minkah Fitzpatrick gobbles it up. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 7-17 Saints 10:20, 4th quarter Shough hits his tight end Juwan Johnson for a 30-yard strike to give the Saints a healthy lead in the final quarter. An upset in the making. Frustrating for my fantasy team as I benched him. Ouch. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 24-17 Browns 14:12, 4th quarter Justin Fields dumps it off to Breece Hall. The running back does the rest. Hall scampers for a 42-yard score. Who needs generational talents on defense anyway? Well against an equally bad team you don\\u2019t anyway. The Jets have not missed Williams and Gardner much so far. Pick! Dolphins 16-6 Bills 8:55, 4th quarter Maybe the comeback is on! Maxwell Hairston picks off Tua Tagovailoa. A brilliant play puts the Bills quickly back on offense on their 24-yard line. If Miami can hold on this would be massive. They have beaten Buffalo once in their past 15 attempts and have lost the last seven in succession. Large if with Allen back o the ball. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 0:58, 3rd quarter Big stop for the Bucs defense. The Pats go for it on 4th down. Drake Maye goes to his talisman Diggs but he can\\u2019t reel it in. Turnover on downs. Baker Mayfield has a shot to retake the lead now. He takes over at midfield. Is the comeback on? Maybe. Josh Allen leads a 98-yard drive with a 35-yard finisher to Keon Coleman. That was three passes in succession for more than 20 yards that kept Miami at sixes and sevens. (Sorry for saying six and seven). On the two pointer Khalil Shakir catches the short pass but can\\u2019t make it into the end zone. That keeps it to a two-score game for Miami. Buccaneers 16-21 Patriots 4:12, 3rd quarter Neil Reynolds on Sky Sports with an absolute nugget for the ages. The touchdown scorer Tez Johnson is Bo Nix\\u2019s adopted brother. The Nix family adopted Johnson at the age of 15. How utterly lovely. How is he not in Denver though? We need brothers reuinted. \\u201cGreat offense beats great defense,\\u201d says Tony Romo. It sure does. Tez Johnson makes a wonderful grab to snap up a 10-yard score. Game on! TOUCHDOWN! Vikings 10-19 Ravens 8:02, 3rd quarter Justice Hill bangs in the one-yard score to give the Ravens a healthy lead. JJ McCarthy needs to step it up here. The young quarterback is 10\\/17 for 134 yards with no touchdowns and two picks. Struggling. Pick! Dolphins 16-0 Bills 5:59, 3rd quarter I think I may have spoken to soon. It appears to just not be Buffalo\\u2019s day. Josh Allen throws an ugly pick in the end zone. Ifeatu Melifonwu says thank you very, very much. Dolphins 16-0 Bills 6:39, 3rd quarter Buffalo enter the red zone for the first time in this game. I wonder when the last time a team prevented Josh Allen from making it inside the 20-yard line for an entire half? On that note Allen quickly takes them to 1st &amp; Goal with a keeper up the middle. Six first downs on this drive v four in the first half. Dolphins 16-0 Bills 10:09, 3rd quarter Josh Allen is quite special too. The quarterback has the ball for an absolute age as he runs backwards and loops around from left to right. He points to Curtis Samuel telling him where to be, the receiver says \\u201cYessir\\u201d and is on hand to convert Buffalo\\u2019s first third down of the day. They then convert another to keep the wheels moving. That improvisation from Allen could be the spark the Bills need. TOUCHDOWN! Bears 7-17 Giants 12:17, 3rd quarter Jaxson Dart scrambles left and looks for the end zone. The rookie finds it for a 24-yard rushing touchdown. This kid is special. Pick! Vikings 10-9 Ravens 12:41, 3rd quarter Strange looking interception for JJ McCarthy as he throws the bomb to Justin Jefferson but his receiver falls over. All alone Marlon Humphrey cannot believe his luck. He is looking around in disbelief as he wanders back up field from the end zone. Weird. TreVeyon Henderson rips a 55-yard home run. The rookie running back showcases his elite speed to shoot through the gap in the line. And he is OUTTA HERE. Superb. The Pats score with the final play of the half then hit again quickly upon resuming. The Bucs will be wondering what has hit them. Pick! Texans 10-20 Jaguars 0:17, 2nd quarter Unreal interception in Houston. Derek Stingley Jr reaches out in front of Trammell and pulls off a one-handed pick. Get this man on offense now. Jets 17-14 Browns 0:55, 2nd quarter Justin Fields is having another statistically sad day. But who cares really as the Jets special teams have them leading, for now at least. The quarterback is 3\\/6 for a net loss of five yards and one interception. The Browns defense is nasty, the Jets offense is nastier. Myles Garret snaffles his second sack of the day to force the punt. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 10-20 Jaguars 1:19, 2nd quarter Just as I put the scores out the Texans muck it all up. Woody Marks finds the edge out left and saunters home for a crucial score before the break. So with five games in for a break here are the scores on the boards. There are 33 seconds left in Miami, Dalton Kincaid with a bad drop there. Tough in the rain though. Bills let the clock die and are in a big hole. Carolina Panthers 7-10 New Orleans Saints Chicago Bears 7-10 New York Giants Houston Texans 3-20 Jacksonville Jaguars Miami Dolphins 16-0 Buffalo Bills Minnesota Vikings 10-9 Baltimore Ravens New York Jets 17-14 Cleveland Browns Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10-14 New England Patriots A punishing 7min 16sec drive from the Patriots arrives at the goal line. Mike Vrabel gets cute by wasting the clock and purposefully running the ball without the intention of scoring on first down. On second they go for it and get stuffed. Slightly embarrassing. On the third attempt Henderson is inches from breaking the plain but the Bucs stay strong. If the Bucs get the stop here on 4th down that would be huge. They pass it. Red zone specialist Stefon Diggs makes the grab under extreme pressure. Amazing play to get his feet down as he falls out on to the sideline. He just scrapes them on the turf and holds on to the ball for the score. What a play. Not how the Patriots wanted to take the lead into half-time but what a relief for New England. So unlucky for Tampa. TOUCHDOWN! Jets 14-14 Browns 10:34, 2nd quarter \\u201cA gorgeous throw from Dillon Gabriel,\\u201d says the commentator in New Jersey. He isn\\u2019t wrong. Gabriel levels it up with a dime to Jerry Jeudy in the end zone. The receiver makes the diving grab for a 22-yard set of six points. Dolphins 13-0 Bills 9:13, 2nd quarter A comedy of errors unfolding in Miami. James Cook coughs up an absolute nightmare of a fumble. He lets go of it and the ball bounces end over end toward the end zone, Miami players keep diving and missing until one eventually just manages to snag it. Josh Allen looks very annoyed. The Dolphins take over on their five-yard line. Pick! Vikings 10-3 Ravens 10:33, 2nd quarter Malaki Starks makes his first NFL interception. It is an absolute beauty, he absolutely posterises Justin Jefferson with a leap up and ahead of him to make the grab. The Ravens take over at Baltimore\\u2019s 22-yard line. TOUCHDOWN! Texans 0-17 Jaguars 11:40, 2nd quarter Parker Washington is playing a blinder in Houston! He made the toe-tapper for Jacksonville\\u2019s first score and has just returned a punt 72 yards for another touchdown. Single handedly demolishing the Texans. It looks over already with Davis Mills still in at quarterback over the injured CJ Stroud. TOUCHDOWN! Panthers 7-10 Saints 9:21, 2nd quarter No Rashid Shaheed, no problem. Chris Olave is pretty good at tearing the roof off the defense too apparently. A lovely stutter move creates the room for Olave to catch from Tyler Shough, who is then off to the races up the right sideline for a 62-yard bomb. TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 13-0 Bills 14:52, 2nd quarter As scorelines go this one is very unexpected. Tua Tagovailoa gives the Dolphins a two-score lead with a fantastic throw to Jaylen Waddle in the end zone. The speedster cruises by the defender and is right on time to catch the 38-yard score. Extra point is no good. Kyle Williams breaks the top off the Bucs defense with a monster 72-yard touchdown. Drake Maye slings it to the open Williams who beats his man and is off like a rocket up the right sideline. A perfect throw from Maye to the receiver perfectly in stride. Huge smile from Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel. He knows his quarterback is special. Special teams are truly special for the Jets. Not happy with just a kick-off return, Isaiah Williams returns a punt for a 74-yard score. Unreal. J-E-T-S, JETS, JETS, JETS! TOUCHDOWN! Dolphins 7-0 Bills A surprise early lead for Miami (2-7) against AFC East rivals Buffalo (6-2), Malik Washington with the score. Latest scores: Panthers 7-3 Saints Bears 7-0 Giants Texans 0-10 Jaguars Dolphins 0-0 Bills Vikings 7-3 Ravens Jets 7-7 Browns Buccaneers 7-0 Patriots TOUCHDOWN! The first score of the 6pm (GMT) games comes in Tampa, Emeka Agbuka putting the Buccaneers up on the Patriots in the Tom Brady classic. Right, here\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve got coming up: (5-4) Carolina Panthers v New Orleans Saints (1-8) (5-3) Chicago Bears v New York Giants (2-7) (3-5) Houston Texans v Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3) (2-7) Miami Dolphins v Buffalo Bills (6-2) (4-4) Minnesota Vikings v Baltimore Ravens (3-5) (1-7) New York Jets v Cleveland Browns (2-6) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers v New England Patriots (7-2) Jonathan Taylor speaking on Sky Sports after his 286-yard day: \\u201cWe understood the assignment!\\u201d Six more for Taylor on first down and now it\\u2019s all about ball security, at least so you think. Taylor puts it beyong doubt as he goes untouched into the end zone to win it as Warren clears the way. Colts 25-25 Falcons 4:44, OT Taylor makes seven hard yards on first down but can\\u2019t make any more on second but then finds a gap on third down. First down and Taylor has more than 250 all purpose yards. Colts into the redzone. Colts 25-25 Falcons 6:44, OT Tyler Warren makes a huge play! Lovely touch on the throw from Jones and the Colts are now probably in good enough position to win this, down to the Falcons\\u2019 22. Colts 25-25 Falcons 7:29, OT It\\u2019s not a great kick and Downs manages to get a few extra yards. Jones will have nice field position to start and they now only need a field goal. Colts 25-25 Falcons 8:14, OT The Falcons cannot get anything going and facing third and long, again, Penix is sacked by Zaire Franklin. They will have to punt. Colts 25-25 Falcons 9:06, OT Penix faces pressure on third down and with the ball harmlessly hitting the turf, but there\\u2019s a flag. New set of downs. Lot\\u2019s of confusion there as the Falcons opt to let the clock run out for a juicy bit of overtime. Berlin with an absolute banger! Danke sch\\u00f6ne! It\\u2019s good! Colts 25-25 Falcons 0:25, 4th quarter Jones is sacked again bringing up another 3rd down. The Colts dump off a short pass to move the kicker closer to tie this up. Badgley has missed two already today. I can\\u2019t look. It\\u2019s \\u2026 GOOD! 44-yard strike levels it. \\u201cThey love their kickers over here,\\u201d quips Kurt Warner. Yeah, we sure love it when they kick the ball in Europe. Colts 22-25 Falcons 1:11, 4th quarter Atlanta\\u2019s pass rush wins again on the very next play. A sixth sack of Jones rocks the Colts back to 3rd &amp; 21. The QB is forced to scramble with no receivers open and he is so, so close to getting it. 4th &amp; 2, pressure, Jones lofts it to Warren who is under even more pressure from Bolin, but makes the catch to move the chains. Brilliant. Colts 22-25 Falcons 1:32, 4th quarter Ameer Abdullah comes up huge for the Colts on the kick return. The speedster races up to midfield giving Jones excellent position to go with the handy amount of clock. After all the excitement, Tyler Warren may have just fumbled. Indy await the referees call nervously. INCOMPLETE. 2nd &amp; 10 to go with one timeout in hand. And they keep slicing and dicing. Tyler Allgeier gets a hat-trick of hand offs that work perfectly. He just keeps banging until he is stopped on the goal line. They keep it with him for the one-yard score. Drake London snatches up the two-point conversion too. You could almost say Atlanta scored a bit too quickly there. Jones has plenty of time to work with. Colts 22-17 Falcons 2:00, 4th quarter What a thriller for Berlin\\u2019s footballing public. Two minutes remain. With the game on the line Atlanta are finally finding some offensive fluency. They slice and dice the Colts, with a heady brew of run and pass, up to Indy\\u2019s 32-yard line. They are in position to win, but can Penix and company deliver? What on Earth!? Jonathan Taylor runs 83 yards for a touchdown to give Indy the lead!!! And it is an incredible one. The back is trapped at the line of scrimmage and I mean pinned up against his linemen but he keeps those giant legs churning to bust out to the left into fresh air. He just keeps running and running and running and running and touchdown! That was set up the Colts say anything you can do to the Falcons D by forcing another punt. Bijan Robinson had them moving until Penix took over on 3rd down. The QB throws long and misses. Not even close, seven failures on 3rd down. It\\u2019s good! Colts 16-17 Falcons 9:00, 4th quarter This Falcons defense is playing out of their minds. A five-yard delay of game penalty knocks some air out of the Indy balloon, and the Colts elect to just buy some yards back with a short pass on 2nd down. On 3rd and long Jones steps up and out of the pocket but is chased down by Brandon Dorlus. That is five sacks now for the Falcons. Mike Badgley bangs in the 34-yarder but it is Atlanta who are celebrating another big stop in the red zone. Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:29, 4th quarter The Colts immediately revert to Taylor, smart thinking as he hits an 18-yard run up the right then an eight-yard scamper to Atlanta\\u2019s 25-yard line. On the third down \\u2026 Jones GETS IT on the QB keeper. Phew. 14th try is the charm after all. Red zone time. Colts 13-17 Falcons 13:56, 4th quarter Three and out for Atlanta. It is all about Sauce Gardner. The corner is all over the field as he stops two passing plays, the second of which could have been a pass interference call as he smashes into Darnell Mooney. A real bully move that gives the receiver no chance of making the grab. No call though, so well played, Sauce. Can I shock you? On the resulting third down the Colts get to Penix so he throws it in the trash. Punt. 13 failures between them on 3rd down now. 13! Outside of two minutes in the first quarter when 21 points ran up the scoreboard these defenses have been superb. Colts 13-17 Falcons 0:47, 3rd quarter Another third down, another failure. What else were you expecting? Jones has no one open so he tries to scramble for it but comes up two yards short. The Colts gamble again as a field goal is fairly useless to them. Taylor is stopped short on the run. Atlanta were ready for it that time. This defense are doing a phenomenal job at stopping Indy. Pittsburgh needed splashy turnovers last week to best them, pure grit and gristle for the Falcons so far. Colts 13-17 Falcons 4:03, 3rd quarter And the wait continues for a third down conversion. Taylor comes up just shy so Indy gamble. One yard for the 1st and of course their bell cow moves the chains this time. 19 yards remain for the Colts. Colts 13-17 Falcons 5:08, 3rd quarter Indy\\u2019s version of protecting the QB appears to be not calling passing plays on this drive. Six plays, six runs. Taylor carries them to midfield only for them to call the screen pass to Tyler Warren who scampers out to the left for 24 yards. About another 24 to go for the go-ahead score. Colts 13-17 Falcons 8:38, 3rd quarter Colts take over and will be hoping to do a better job of protecting the quarterback. The Falcons have sacked Jones four times. Ouch. Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:19, 3rd quarter Drake London 1-1 Sauce Gardner. WOW! Gardner almost picks off a Penix throw to London. The corner jumps the route perfectly to put him in prime position for an easy interception. But Butter fingers strike and he drops it. Still, he breaks up the play and the Falcons must punt. And we continue to wait for one of these two to convert a third down. Both are 0-5. Sort it out! Colts 13-17 Falcons 10:19, 3rd quarter The Colts were cruising down the field there, until they weren\\u2019t. Daniel Jones is monstered by Atlanta\\u2019s pass rush not once but twice. Firstly Jones is pressured into fumbling but he manages to recover setting up a long 3rd down. He fails on his second try as James Pearce forces the fumble after a huge sack. Atlanta are causing serious problems, they take over at midfield. Colts 13-17 Falcons 12:19, 3rd quarter Excellent field position for Indy. They set up show on Atlanta\\u2019s 44-yard line after a 50-yard return by Ashton Dulin. Their position gets even better on the next play as Jonathan Taylor breaks off a 24-yard run after a short catch. It\\u2019s good! Colts 13-17 Falcons 12:26, 3rd quarter And that is the second touchdown Pitts should have had on another missed third down. Only this time it is all on the quarterback. He throws deep into the left corner of the end zone with his tight end on his mark to make the catch. Penix\\u2019s throw is slow and short, with no arc on the ball it bonks Jaylon Jones on the helmet before reaching Pitts and pops harmlessly out of play. Zane Gonzalez makes the 43-yard kick. Colts 13-14 Falcons 12:54, 3rd quarter Atlanta start the second half on offense and are already deep into enemy territory after a 25-yard grab from Kyle Pitts. Bijan Robinson then rumbles for another first down. A missed tackle at the line of scrimmage sets up the run to Indy\\u2019s 30-yard line. Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time It turns out a lot of people have heard of THE Kid Laroi to give him his full title. Stay with Justin Bieber has 3,714,698,060 streams on Spotify. Nearly four billion, what\\u2019s that translate to as income, hmmm \\u2026 37 quid a month? Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time Despite a few offensive fireworks, the defenses have shown some serious muscle. Neither team have converted a third down yet. Three failures for Atlanta and four for Indy. Anyone ever heard of this bloke Kid Laroi doing the half-time show? I use the word bloke advisedly as he hails from Australia. Google tells me has done a song with Justin Bieber. I think that might be this second tune. Certainly better than the opener. Apologies, Mr Laroi. Colts 13-14 Falcons, half-time Interception! Jones takes a huge sack for a 10-yard loss and it looks like Indy are going to run the clock out. Only they dial up the deep pass and it goes wrong. Jones massively underthrows his receiver and is picked off by Jessie Bates. Atlanta have some time but not enough to extend their lead. Indy avoid what could have been an ugly own goal. Drake London 1-0 Sauce Gardner. The cornerback slips as London has an easy catch to move the chains. Not that he would have broken it up even if he had stayed vertical. For the touchdown London makes a 16-yard grab with the ball flying over his head, the red zone monster sticks his mitts out and that is all she wrote. Germaine Pratt never had a chance in coverage, Gardner had scampered off with Kyle Pitts. London has 72 yards on four receptions so far. Colts 13-7 Falcons 6:57, 2nd quarter The defenses are settling down into their assignments now. The combatants trade punts on a lesser-spotted three and out for Indianapolis. Atlanta take over at their 45-yard line, well placed to strike back before half-time. The Colts defense will have something to say about that though. They have done a great job of confusing Penix Jr so far by faking pressure at the line of scrimmage then dropping back into coverage. It\\u2019s no good! Colts 13-7 Falcons 10:40, 2nd quarter Mike Badgley is having a shocker. He misses the mark after a lucky escape for Jones who fumbles but is saved by the ball going out of bounds. The QB tries a scramble and upon impact from a defender sheds the rock but the Falcons just cannot get the ball under control. The drive loses steam and so out comes the kicker. The 53-yard effort comes up painfully short. Four points left out on the field already today for Indy. Colts 13-7 Falcons 12:45, 2nd quarter Pierce is involved again as he moves the Colts up to midfield with a 26-yard grab. Tyler Warren then provides the safety net for Jones who was inches from taking a huge sack. The rookie makes a punishing run after the catch through two defenders and keeps the chains moving in the process. Indi are moving the ball with ease so far. Colts 13-7 Falcons 15:00, 2nd quarter The opening quarter winds to a close with the Colts fighting out from their two-yard line to the 26. An excellent punt pinned them back but they are coming again. Colts 13-7 Falcons 4:36, 1st quarter And our commentary team kindly informs us that Pierce\\u2019s brother played basketball in Germany. So him scoring today was meant to be I suppose. We have a first glimpse of Sauce Garnder then as he attempts a peanut punch, no bueno sadly. One minute later and Indianapolis have retaken the lead. End-to-end stuff. Alec Pierce catches an unbelievable home-run shot from Daniel Jones for a 37-yard touchdown. The receiver is sandwiched between two defenders in the end zone but makes a soaring catch thanks to a pass that perfectly finds its mark between them. Before that Jonathan Taylor put his QB in range with a supremely feisty run for 28 yards, actually carrying a chasing defender at one point. What a game we have already here. Penix Jr puts the fumble behind him by marching his Falcons down the field for a score of their own. Drake London makes some chunky receptions to put them in the red zone then the seas part for Tyler Allgeier to saunter on to the goal line through the heart of the field for 13 yards. The running back finishes it off for a one-yard touchdown of his own. Advantage Atlanta. Did Kyle Pitts just drop a touchdown? The tight end drops a clanger, he was very open but the ball just swishes through his hands. That play rather sums up the first round pick\\u2019s career to date. So far, so disappointing but it only gets worse for the Falcons as they cough the ball back to the Colts on the 23-yard line. Michael Penix Jr is hunted down and can\\u2019t keep hold of the ball. A nifty 22-yard run from Ashton Dulin sets Jonathan Taylor up to roll in for the score on the following play. Kicker Michael Badgley skews the extra point wide. Oops. Colts 0-0 Falcons 10:51, 1st quarter And the drama keeps coming as the Colts go for it on 4th down. The gamble fails to pay off as Josh Downs cannot reel in a fastball from Jones. On the play before the turnover on downs Jessie Bates put a huge hit on tight end Mo Alie-Cox. The Falcons have come out fighting on defense as they try and snap their three-game losing streak. Next up Sauce Garner\\u2019s debut! Colts 0-0 Falcons 13:30, 1st quarter Here we go! And we have early drama after Jonathan Taylor catches a screen pass, sweeps out for 15 yards to the right then fumbles \\u2026 only for his center to save his bacon with the recovery. Colts are in Falcons territory already. Not to be outdone the singer belting out the Star Spangled Banner has some of the largest shoulder pads you are ever likely to see. Loving the sartorial choices today. We are almost underway after a choral number for the German anthem. Classy. As sparkly jackets go that is an absolute belter from Katarina Witt on the coin toss. Did the referee say she was an Olympic tennis champion? Figure skating was Witt\\u2019s game I believe. A slight fluff from Sky Sports there as we hear \\u201cwho won the toss?\\u201d from the presenter with an unfortunately hot mic. Well, the Colts have won the toss and have elected to receive. Daniel Jones and company will be setting up shortly. Will the QB bounce back after a rough one in Pittsburgh? And for afters the jumbo package starting at 12pm CST\\/1pm EST\\/6pm GMT (home teams listed first) is as follows: (5-4) Carolina Panthers v New Orleans Saints (1-8) (5-3) Chicago Bears v New York Giants (2-7) (3-5) Houston Texans v Jacksonville Jaguars (5-3) (2-7) Miami Dolphins v Buffalo Bills (6-2) (4-4) Minnesota Vikings v Baltimore Ravens (3-5) (1-7) New York Jets v Cleveland Browns (2-6) (6-2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers v New England Patriots (7-2) What a feast. I\\u2019m planting my flag on Minnesota and Baltimore playing out the game of the day. Guten tag, fussball fans. Wie gehts? Alles klar I hope on this fine early start to week 10 coming straight outta Deutschland. The Olympiastadion in Berlin to be exact where at 8.30am CST\\/9.30am EST and 2.30pm GMT the mighty Indianapolis Colts (7-2) take on the Atlanta Falcons (3-5). The fifth game played on German soil and the first in the nation\\u2019s capital. The news hounds among you may have picked up on the Colts being involved in some rather large business on trade deadline day. So what looked like an intriguing one between a playoff contender and a team fighting to turn things around has been turned up several notches by Indianapolis trading for star cornerback Sauce Gardner. Yes, on Tuesday they engaged in some rather punchy retail therapy to shake off the sadness of losing to Pittsburgh. The Colts dispensed two future first-round draft picks and receiver Adonai Mitchell in exchange for the highest paid corner in the NFL. Indianapolis are all in on the Super Bowl and handily Gardner has cleared concussion protocol for a first appearance since week seven today to aid that endeavour. His first assignment will most likely be tracking Drake London. As head-to-heads go this could be a classic. Atlanta\\u2019s premier pass catcher starts in good form after nabbing three touchdowns last week with more than 100 yards in three of his past four games. So no pressure, Sauce. But the $120m man will likely back himself. A good on good matchup as they say.

(175, 58, 11, 'us-news/2025/nov/09/usda-trump-undo-snap-food-aid-payments', 'US agriculture department tells states to ‘undo’ Snap benefits for families in need', 'Directive comes after supreme court order allowing Trump officials to pause food aid payments amid shutdown', 'The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is directing states to “immediately undo” any steps that have been taken to send out full food aid benefits to low-income Americans, following a supreme court order on Friday that temporarily halted a lower court order requiring those payments. The USDA’s directive, issued in a memo on Saturday, followed a supreme court order granting the Trump administration’s emergency request to pause an order for the USDA to provide full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown, which is now in its 40th day. That lower court ruling, issued on Thursday, ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the Snap program for November by Friday, rather than issuing only partial benefits. The ruling led to some of the roughly 42 million Americans enrolled in Snap – commonly known as food stamps – to begin receiving their full benefits on Friday from the states, which issue the payments of federal dollars. But on Friday night, the program was thrown into chaos again when the supreme courtagreed to temporarily pause the order to allow an appeals court to review the Trump administration’s appeal. In response to the supreme court’s decision, the USDA, which delivers the money to the states, issued its directive that any payments that had been made under the prior orders are considered “unauthorized”. “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, the deputy undersecretary of agriculture, wrote to state Snap directors. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.” The memo warned: “Failure to comply with this memorandum may results in USDA taking various actions, including cancellation of the Federal share of State administration costs and holding States liable for any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.” As the Associated Press reports, it remains unclear if the directive applies to states using their some of their own funds to sustain the program, or just to ones relying entirely on federal money. The USDA did not immediately respond to a request for clarification from the AP. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator for Alaska, said it would be “shocking” if the order applied to states using their own money to support the program. “It’s one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, ‘No, this can’t be done,’” Murkowski told the AP. “But when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we’re going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.” On Sunday several state leaders criticized the memo. Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, refused to abide by the directive. “No,” Evers said in a statement responding to the memo. “Pursuant to and consistent with an active court order, Wisconsin legally loaded benefits to cards, ensuring nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites, including nearly 270,000 kids, had access to basic food and groceries.” He added that the Trump administration had “assured Wisconsin and other states that they were actively working to implement full SNAP benefits for November and would ‘complete the processes necessary to make funds available”, adding that “they have failed to do so to date.” “Our administration is actively in court fighting against the Trump administration’s efforts to yank food assistance away from Wisconsin’s kids, families and seniors and we are eager for the court to resolve this issue by directing the Trump administration to comply with court orders and provide the certainty to the many Wisconsin families and businesses who rely on FoodShare,” Evers said. Oregon’s Democratic governor, Tina Kotek, said in a statement that “Trump’s demands have no impact on” the money she distributed on Thursday in line with the court order. “Oregon acted lawfully, given the federal court’s directive and the communications with the USDA, and my decision to ensure SNAP benefits went out quickly was in direct alignment with my food emergency declaration,” Kotek said. “I am disgusted that President Trump has the audacity to take taxpayers’ money away from them when they are in crisis. I have a question for the President: What would he prefer to spend the money on over groceries for people in need? This is ridiculous, immoral, and Oregon will fight this every step of the way.” Maura Healey, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, also condemned the directive in a statement on Sunday, saying: “If President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court.” “Massachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food” she said. “These funds were processed in accordance with guidance we received from the Trump Administration and a lower court order, and they were processed before the Supreme Court order on Friday night.” “President Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families,” she added. Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator for Minnesota, also criticized the memo, saying that “cruelty is the point”, adding: “It is their choice to do this.” Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/usda-trump-undo-snap-food-aid-payments', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/bdcb1ebb2cc48bc86c8d92bca124b32dd9dcd0cf/1328_0_6827_5464/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/usda-trump-undo-snap-food-aid-payments\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T21:37:34Z\",\"webTitle\":\"US agriculture department tells states to \\u2018undo\\u2019 Snap benefits for families in need\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/usda-trump-undo-snap-food-aid-payments\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/usda-trump-undo-snap-food-aid-payments\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"US agriculture department tells states to \\u2018undo\\u2019 Snap benefits for families in need\",\"trailText\":\"Directive comes after supreme court order allowing Trump officials to pause food aid payments amid shutdown\",\"byline\":\"Anna Betts and agencies\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/bdcb1ebb2cc48bc86c8d92bca124b32dd9dcd0cf\\/1328_0_6827_5464\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is directing states to \\u201cimmediately undo\\u201d any steps that have been taken to send out full food aid benefits to low-income Americans, following a supreme court order on Friday that temporarily halted a lower court order requiring those payments.

(176, 59, 8, 'football/2025/nov/09/jeremy-doku-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league', 'Dazzling Doku weaves his magic to spark Manchester City’s title charge', 'The winger’s thrilling performance made elite footballers vanish and surely ended Liverpool’s title defence', 'For heaven’s sake, Jérémy. You’re not supposed to actually enjoy these games. Except, it seems sometimes you can, even at this rarefied level. Perhaps the most striking part of Jérémy Doku’s thrilling performance here was its playfulness, the sense of fun, the way he was into it from the first moment, basically dancing out there. Doku has the nickname The Count, a reference to the Star Wars Sith Lord Count Dooku. His performance against Liverpool was more like watching the young Yoda scything his way around one of those mass lightsaber massacres, whirling and gliding, aware of space, wind, the crumpling of a blade of grass behind him. Doku has one particular move, The Wand. Essentially he waves his foot over the ball and runs off the other way. Sounds easy. You try doing it. Here he spent his entire 74 minutes on the pitch making elite footballers vanish. He did it to Mo Salah an hour into a gruelling game on a sodden pitch. A bit later he was double-teamed by Ryan Gravenberch and Conor Bradley, slowed to a walk, stopped, then out came the wand. Expelliarmus! They both vanished, Doku easing through the space to batter a shot at goal. He was always going to score. When he did it was in part a product of the mental pain inflicted on the Liverpool defence in the preceding 62 minutes. Ibrahima Konaté was wary of getting too close. From there Doku didn’t need to use his full range, just jinked to his right and walloped a thrilling shot into the far corner, a hard, flat, howling thing, basically unsaveable. Doku came off with the game done at 3-0, having completed seven dribbles, at a point where nobody else on the pitch had got past one. He has always had extraordinary gifts, amazing numbers on the physical tests, the standing jump, the sideways snap. In full flow here it looked like trying to play against a mobile forcefield, such is his control, the speed of his feet, the power of his thighs and shoulders. This is Doku’s third season in Manchester. He’s still only 23. Pep Guardiola was careful afterwards not to overpraise him, suggesting he probably won’t ever be a truly prolific goalscorer. But it was a performance that might just make him into something else. It was too much for Liverpool in any case. This may or may not be the beginning of City’s title charge. But it is surely the end of Liverpool’s defence. The champions have lost five league games with 27 still to play. Title winners generally lose between three and six. Something dramatic would have to happen to this team. But it doesn’t look like it will. True, Liverpool had a goal disallowed for a very silly notion of offside. They had some good spells. Florian Wirtz played well. But if Arne Slot is struggling to find effective patterns, the poverty of his team only served to demonstrate how peerlessly good Guardiola is at this; just as Doku’s development is a perfect example of what Guardiola loves, that wild hunger for building teams and working at players. Manchester had been agreeable, damp and mild at kick-off, with moody skies and squalls of drizzle, the most Sunday of all November Sundays. What stood out early on was City’s fluidity. Doku roamed, as did Rayan Cherki and Bernardo Silva. Konaté had one of those days where he seems to be playing in roller skates. But he suffered also from the brittleness of Liverpool’s midfield. Before kick-off City had screened a gushing coronational video in honour of Pep’s 1,000th game as a manager. The opening goal was this team’s own tribute, like a flick back through ages. It began deep on the left, Doku and Silva zipping the ball forward, one of those moments where a team just seems to be speaking to itself. From there it became like a version of Carlos Alberto’s back-to-front goal for Brazil against Italy in 1970, but with a modern mash-up of controlled possession chucked into the mix as City showcased some classic Pep style, like one of those moments at an Olympics opening ceremony where suddenly everyone’s morris dancing or Tim Berners-Lee is inventing the internet. From there it was current Pep. Matheus Nunes swung in a cross for Erling Haaland to score with a header that was either a bit fortunate in its slight deflection off Konaté, or a case of the more I lurk in space waiting to head the ball in, the luckier I get. Either side of the goal City were far the better team, and in an interesting way. Guardiola’s triple No 10 system looks full of promise. Seven of the starting outfield 10 were 23 or under. Nico González had another fine game. Phil Foden looks bright and perky. Even his hair looks different, looser and more expressive, the hair of a well-groomed pirate. And City have now won five out of their past six in the league. They must be serious title challengers, maybe even favourites given they have done this many times before, that there are no bars to be raised or ghosts to be slain. Guardiola can surely feel it, even if he won’t say.

Perhaps the most striking part of J\\u00e9r\\u00e9my Doku\\u2019s thrilling performance here was its playfulness, the sense of fun, the way he was into it from the first moment, basically dancing out there. Doku has the nickname The Count, a reference to the Star Wars Sith Lord Count Dooku. His performance against Liverpool was more like watching the young Yoda scything his way around one of those mass lightsaber massacres, whirling and gliding, aware of space, wind, the crumpling of a blade of grass behind him. Doku has one particular move, The Wand. Essentially he waves his foot over the ball and runs off the other way. Sounds easy. You try doing it. Here he spent his entire 74 minutes on the pitch making elite footballers vanish. He did it to Mo Salah an hour into a gruelling game on a sodden pitch. A bit later he was double-teamed by Ryan Gravenberch and Conor Bradley, slowed to a walk, stopped, then out came the wand. Expelliarmus! They both vanished, Doku easing through the space to batter a shot at goal. He was always going to score. When he did it was in part a product of the mental pain inflicted on the Liverpool defence in the preceding 62 minutes. Ibrahima Konat\\u00e9 was wary of getting too close. From there Doku didn\\u2019t need to use his full range, just jinked to his right and walloped a thrilling shot into the far corner, a hard, flat, howling thing, basically unsaveable. Doku came off with the game done at 3-0, having completed seven dribbles, at a point where nobody else on the pitch had got past one. He has always had extraordinary gifts, amazing numbers on the physical tests, the standing jump, the sideways snap. In full flow here it looked like trying to play against a mobile forcefield, such is his control, the speed of his feet, the power of his thighs and shoulders. This is Doku\\u2019s third season in Manchester. He\\u2019s still only 23. Pep Guardiola was careful afterwards not to overpraise him, suggesting he probably won\\u2019t ever be a truly prolific goalscorer. But it was a performance that might just make him into something else. It was too much for Liverpool in any case. This may or may not be the beginning of City\\u2019s title charge. But it is surely the end of Liverpool\\u2019s defence. The champions have lost five league games with 27 still to play. Title winners generally lose between three and six. Something dramatic would have to happen to this team. But it doesn\\u2019t look like it will. True, Liverpool had a goal disallowed for a very silly notion of offside. They had some good spells. Florian Wirtz played well. But if Arne Slot is struggling to find effective patterns, the poverty of his team only served to demonstrate how peerlessly good Guardiola is at this; just as Doku\\u2019s development is a perfect example of what Guardiola loves, that wild hunger for building teams and working at players. Manchester had been agreeable, damp and mild at kick-off, with moody skies and squalls of drizzle, the most Sunday of all November Sundays. What stood out early on was City\\u2019s fluidity. Doku roamed, as did Rayan Cherki and Bernardo Silva. Konat\\u00e9 had one of those days where he seems to be playing in roller skates. But he suffered also from the brittleness of Liverpool\\u2019s midfield. Before kick-off City had screened a gushing coronational video in honour of Pep\\u2019s 1,000th game as a manager. The opening goal was this team\\u2019s own tribute, like a flick back through ages. It began deep on the left, Doku and Silva zipping the ball forward, one of those moments where a team just seems to be speaking to itself. From there it became like a version of Carlos Alberto\\u2019s back-to-front goal for Brazil against Italy in 1970, but with a modern mash-up of controlled possession chucked into the mix as City showcased some classic Pep style, like one of those moments at an Olympics opening ceremony where suddenly everyone\\u2019s morris dancing or Tim Berners-Lee is inventing the internet. From there it was current Pep. Matheus Nunes swung in a cross for Erling Haaland to score with a header that was either a bit fortunate in its slight deflection off Konat\\u00e9, or a case of the more I lurk in space waiting to head the ball in, the luckier I get. Either side of the goal City were far the better team, and in an interesting way. Guardiola\\u2019s triple No 10 system looks full of promise. Seven of the starting outfield 10 were 23 or under. Nico Gonz\\u00e1lez had another fine game. Phil Foden looks bright and perky. Even his hair looks different, looser and more expressive, the hair of a well-groomed pirate. And City have now won five out of their past six in the league. They must be serious title challengers, maybe even favourites given they have done this many times before, that there are no bars to be raised or ghosts to be slain. Guardiola can surely feel it, even if he won\\u2019t say. And Arsenal will too from here.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/sport\",\"pillarName\":\"Sport\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL),

(178, 61, 10, 'tv-and-radio/live/2025/nov/08/strictly-come-dancing-week-seven-live', 'Strictly Come Dancing: week seven results – as it happened', 'Vicky Pattison’s fierce tango topped the scores, while Balvinder Sopal brought Bollywood flavour to the ballroom. La Voix was bottom of the leaderboard after a flop foxtrot. But who would bow out at the contest’s midway mark?', 'Thanks for watching along with me, glittery gang. Our surviving eight pairs now progress to the eighth live show, which sees them bidding to make it through to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom special. Yes, the other B-word will soon be bandied about more than Brexit. It airs at next Saturday at the same time of 6.25pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to see who deserves to be beside the seaside, beside the sea. In the meantime, you know what to do: keeeeep dancing! Nighty-night and have a good week. JimJayuu says: “That was a tight decision alright. I admit a bit of bias here but I did think La Voix was slightly better in the dance-off and obviously the inclusion of the much discussed heel turn in her dance may have just swung it to her. Next week is going to be interesting because she may benefit from a ‘get La Voix to Blackpool’ vote, which then potentially leaves Balvinder and Amber at risk. It is getting harder and harder to call these.” Finally, Tanya92 adds: “Aw, I’m sad to see Harry go, although happy to have another week of Alivoix. The whole cast are so good and seem like a lovely bunch of people. Can we keep them all from here on?” Diamondcat says: “Well, I don’t agree. I really did think Harry was better but there you go. I think La Voix will be out next week.” TheMathDiva says: “Harry is a lovely, genuine bloke. Nice exit speech.” EdiSteve says: “Well that’s a daft result, Harry was loads better in the dance-off. La Voix was worse than in the first show, lots of wobbly walking, while Harry shimmied marvelously.” MikeMoonlight adds: “So it’s farewell to Harry. It’s good that the current young generation have one of the new TV Gladiators as a role model. I’m sure they will take him to their hearts and minds with the same passion and vigour that a previous generation of teenagers took to Jet in the 90s! Oh, hang on a minute...” Fihema says: “James Morrison is reminding me of an in-tune Rod Stewart.” VictoriasSecret says: “Really pleased that we get a little more La Voix. Both couples are both a bit adrift of the overall stranded, but La Voix is entertaining every week and I want a little bit more.” irreverentnurse says: “I’ll cut your hair, George. I do my own sometimes. My husband calls it self-harming behaviour when I do. It can go either way.” Somersetlass says: “OK, given the scores, these are the correct couples in the dance-off. So relieved Alex is through. As I wasn’t able to vote last night, the guilt would have been unbearable.” Strictlylounging adds: “Mr Lounging, who is an ex-military musician, has just said that this brass band are regarded as one of the best in the military music world. He said it grudgingly, because they’re RAF, but high praise indeed!” Somersetlass says: “What a beautiful Children In Need segment on This Is Us and Christopher. His mum’s not the only one who’s welling up.” LazyMillennial says: “As a neurodivergent, I just wish I had the same support and understanding as this young man growing up. There are sometimes reasons to be happy about the future.” Time for a rapid-fire round-up of your comments. lester48 says: “Get Craig on next year’s Celebrity Traitors.” TeeDubyaBee says: “Dave Arch clearly got the ‘more cowbell’ memo from Christopher Walken.” Lidoswimmer says: “Surely Dave Arch deserves some kind of statue/plaque/bank holiday?” jagadox adds: You never know what’s going to be in the woods here. Worse, dashing out across the road driving at nigh. What’s that? Sodding hell, it’s a wild boar. They can really mess up your car and it doesn’t do the pig much good either.” TV viewers can now stay on BBC1 for Antiques Roadshow, flip to ITV1 for the Bullseye reboot, head to Channel 4 for Game Of Wool: Britain’s Best Knitter or for more hoofing fun, it’s Dance Night over on BBC4 - kicking off with Dance Passion Bradford, before a rerun of Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake introduced by Sir Matthew himself. At 9pm, choose from new drama Trespasses on Channel 4, Riot Women on BBC1, Trigger Point on ITV1, Hunted on Channel 4 or Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing on BBC2. Film recommendations, you say? I’m glad you asked. Tonight there’s The Day of the Jackal (9pm on Legend Xtra), Lethal Weapon (9pm on ITV4), My Best Friend’s Wedding (10.40pm on E4), 1917 (10.50pm on BBC2) and Stand By Me (11.10pm on Film4). I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone? Two other celebrities will be counting their lucky stars tonight. Alex Kingston might have topped the leaderboard twice but she seriously struggled with the paso doble and plummeted down to second bottom. She will be relieved she never has to do that dance again. Alex was looking like a potential finalist but if she doesn’t bounce back next time, those hopes might dwindle. Meanwhile, George Clarke improved on his recent form with his Viennese waltz but in a fast-improving field, he has become mid-table fodder. The YouTuber was another tip for the final who has taken a dip. George needs to start turning up the wow factor if he’s going to dance into December. EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal feared the worst way back in week three when she appeared in the bottom two. Yet five weekends and three dance-offs later, she deservedly lives to dance another day. It’s testament to her pluck, hard work and how pro partner Julian Caillon has helped keep her spirits up. Last night’s joyous Punjabi-spiced Couple’s Choice was her best performance yet. If she can carry that confidence forward and tackle every dance style with the same expressive enjoyment, Ballroom Bal might just defy the bookies for another few weeks. In her 14th series, Strictly’s longest-serving pro landed her most promising celebrity partner for five years. Venezuelan-born firecracker Karen Hauer clearly relished teaming up with athlete Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who was capable of flinging her around and even doing press-ups with Karen standing on his back. Those lifts during their Lion King salsa in Movie Week looked almost effortless. Karen also got to perform her first Argentine tango in 13 years and a rumba which had the judges coming over all a-flutter about their chemistry. Since reaching the 2020 final with Jamie Laing, she’d fallen into an uncanny pattern of finishing 12th every series - with Greg Wise, Jayde Adams, Eddie Kadi and Paul Merson, in chronological order. Coming ninth with Harry is her longest run for some time. Karen was at risk of becoming the female Anton du Beke, saddled with the early leavers. Start your engines. The Drag Race runner-up managed to rev herself up and overtake her rival when it mattered. La Voix finished bottom of the Saturday night scoreboard, one point below Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. Yet when they competed in the dance-off, she not only closed the gap but outshone him sufficiently to earn a unanimous judges’ decision. An impressive result from an experienced performer who knows how to turn it on – not to mention do a heel lead right in front of the judges’ table. She’s still the lowest average scorer left in the contest and looks like she could be dance-off fodder on a more regular basis now. La Voix always brings the entertainment factor - not least with her pre-dance skits and post-dance quips to the judges - but the longer the contest goes on, the harder they will clamp down on technique. Time for her and Aljaž Škorjanec to really knuckle down in training. She needs to go from La Voix to La Danse or she could soon sashay away. He had potential to last another week or two but it’s hard to argue that Harry Aikines-Aryeetey didn’t deserve to be eliminated. His form has dipped in recent weeks, with his bizarre space-themed, silver foil-clad American smooth in Halloween week leaving him bottom of the leaderboard. Last night’s samba was a slight improvement but still left him a single point off the bottom. In a high-quality field – this was the closest ever week seven scoreboard, with just 10 points separating top from bottom - a few mistakes and two lacklustre weeks on the trot proved fatal. He failed to raise his game enough for the dance-off and was left in the glittery dust by La Voix. At least the Olympian and Gladiators star bowed out with a broad smile and a party dance. His samba might have lacked technical precision but it was joyous and celebratory. A fitting end because his full-beam energy lit up the contest. His dancing pecs and rippling six-pack had a few admirers, too. Harry struggled with control at times - partner Karen Hauer said trying to rein him in was like “trying to put a brake on a stallion” - but he brought charisma, sparkle and swagger to every routine. His highlights were his spicy Lion King salsa (those lifts!) and his sensual Argentine tango (that sizzle!). Now Nitro packed up his pugil stick and boarded the big travelator home. Another one bites the dust. As the eliminated pair take a farewell turn around the ballroom to Against All Odds by Phil Collins (tune), their castmates crowd in for cuddles and the credits roll. Please stay with us for analysis and reaction. Harry’s partner Karen says: “I am extremely proud of Harry. We’ve had the best time. You’re such a gentleman, you’re a hard worker. I loved you in every kind of way because of the person that you are. I was an honour to teach you, so thank you so much.” She’s a good’un, that Hotlips Hauer. In his exit interview with Tess Daly, Harry says: “First of all, I just want to thank Karen. Genuinely, you have given me an opportunity to shine. You’ve understood my crazy brain. I’m such a logical person, obviously doing what I do - Olympic sprinter, Gladiator - now I was trying to be a dancer. I just want to thank you so much for the time and effort, the hard work that you’ve put into me. You show up, you turn out. I want to thank everyone here. Literally, this has been a dream come true. This is a celebration. I spoke to my daughter and when she saw me sad last week, she was like, ‘Daddy what’s wrong?’ I wanted to show everyone that, no matter what happens, there’s always a silver lining. This has been an experience for me. So thank you for this lovely gift. At the end of the day, we carry on, we give it to them and we continue to shine. Do you know what I mean?” Um, sort of. But well said, Harry. Her casting vote wasn’t needed but Motsi would also have saved La Voix and Aljaž. There it is. The Gladiators star and Olympic sprinter becomes the sixth celebrity to be eliminated and the seventh overall to depart the Strictly 2025 dancefloor. La Voix and Aljaž, saying “evenly matched but for their improvement”. La Voix and Aljaž, saying “both danced better but because of her musicality”. La Voix and Aljaž, saying “both couples improved but for clarity of technique”. Over to the paddle-raising panel. They all scored both couples the same last night except Craig, who scored Harry one point more than La Voix. Have they seen anything to change their minds? They will go on our first whistle. Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Karen Hauer have another go at their show-closing samba to Samba by Gloria Estefan. The judges said last night that it was a crowd-pleaser with bounce and rhythm but he needed to work on his feet and knees. Can Harry soften them second time around? It scored 30 points, only one more than La Voix, so he needs to be on his AA-game. La Voix and Aljaž Škorjanec reprise their foxtrot to Make Your Own Kind of Music by Cass Elliot. The judges said last night that uplifting and joyous but her heel turns were “a little home-made”, her stride pattern got short, her left shoulder raised and it was flat-footed. Otherwise, perfect! It scored 29 points, just one fewer than Harry, so this will be a close call. Can La Voix raise her game, slip in that crucial heel lead and close the gap? Musical interlude now from husky-voiced rock-soul troubadour James Morrison, performing Fight Another Day - the title track from his recent top five album. Choreographic accompaniment is provided by Jowita Pryzstał and Neil Jones. The Polish pocket rocket and the ginger ninja, together at last. Kids have been imitating their Couple’s Choice moves on TikTok, apparently. Claudia looks suitably baffled. They’re dancing a tango next week. More balcony badinage with the relieved pairs. Alex Kingston tells us about Johannes Radebe’s phobia of English woodland. They geed themselves up this week with Ride On Time by Black Box. Banger. The last two pairs puff out of their cheeks and progress to next week. Well, she was bottom of the scoreboard so perhaps’s that’s no surprise. La Voix and her pro partner Aljaž Škorjanec are also in the dance-off for the first time. Gladiator ready? Pro partner ready? Harry and Karen Hauer are consigned to the dreaded dance-off for the first time. But who will they be up against? Now to find out who else is safely through to week eight - and who might not be. Hold me, Bubble. Simple, heartfelt and elegant. A reminder that more of these group numbers should be trad ballroom, rather than try-hard gimmicky affairs. It’s what Strictly does best. Choreographed by the excellent Matt Flint, it’s a fittingly old-fashioned ballroom number with dancing in formation and lots of lifts. Time for a poignant group number from the Strictly professionals to honour the courage, dedication and sacrifice of our Armed Forces. Joined by the Band of the Royal Air Force Regiment, it’s set to Sam Fender’s Remember My Name. We begin with Lauren Oakley and Aljaž Škorjanec creating a lovely atmosphere, before the rest of the pro troupe join in. Claudia tees up a compilation of “her husband” Dave Arch playing a succession of instruments last night. No wonder they’re so happily married. Motsi pays tribute to Vicky’s tango and its clarity of performance. Thrilled to ribbons. Shirley Ballas praises Balvinder and Julian’s Couple’s Choice. Anton loved Amber and Nikita’s seamless lifts, then demonstrates one with Shirley. Strictly’s Health &amp; Safety officer just had a minor seizure. The paddle-raising panel sashay up to the Clauditorium for some Cake By The Ocean and a closer peek at last night’s routines. Craig discusses Alex Kingston’s paso doble problems. A lovely VT now about 16-year-old Strictly superfan Christopher, who has autism and had his life transformed the This Is Us Dance company, supported by Children In Need. He got to meet Nikita and Anton, his favourites, and was shown around the Elstree ballrom. Keep dancing, Christopher. Amber and Nikita are dancing a paso doble to Dream On next week. Not two. Wise. Although the second bunny is in her sights too. That all clear? Good. Salt and vinegar is her preference. She and George Clarke are dancing to Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know next week. She’s spent most of this week googling somebody called Linda Hop. I think I was at school with her. She came down from Leeds for a supportive cuddle. Up in the Clauditorium with the five relieved couples who are safely through to next week, Balvinder Sopal also pays tribute to partner Julian Caillon embracing her Punjabi culture for last night’s Couple’s Choice. Also returning to the dancefloor are Balvinder Sopal, Vicky Pattison, George Clarke and Karen Carney. Stand by, the scarlet spotlight of doom is about to be switched on at the Elstree mains. Our nine couples wait to hear their fates. Flutterbies in their stomachs, I’ll wager. The paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas take their seats. Hope Craig and Anton have kissed and made up. They seemed a bit snippy with one another last night, no? A rewind of Saturday night’s routines on-screen now. Vicky’s tango tops the scores! Amber’s feet barely touch the floor! Balvinder busts out Punjabi moves! Carlos tries to keep up with Karen! Here’s our presenting pair so let’s do a rig-out reckoning. Tess Daly is in a white halterneck jumpsuit. Claudia Winkleman is in a long skirt with button-and-cuff details. Tess wins, making it one-all this weekend. Fair. Which of these smiling couples will soon be wheeling their suitcase to the taxi of tears? Roll a backstage VT from last night. Frocks! Fake tan! Cameras! A distinct lack of shirt buttons! Action! Email just in from Iain in Montreal: Awaiting the results of last night’s show, I can’t help but feel the biggest thing missing was the cheerful exuberance of Ellie Goldstein’s partnership with Vito. I’m as partial to a dancing pectoral a la Harry as anyone, but they are readily found on the internet if one ever feels the need. The joyous feel-good factor of Ellie and Vito’s performances is unique and greatly missed. Buckle up, fleckerl fans. We’re about to return to the Elstree Studios ballroom… New wildlife series Kingdom just drawing to a close on BBC1 right now. This David Attenborough-narrated six-parter follows four rival families – leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions – trying to claim a corner of Zambia as their home. It’s basically a furry Game of Thrones. Not long to wait now… It was announced in last night’s live show that this week’s decisive dance-off vote goes to judge Motsi Mabuse. She was the most generous with her scoring last night, doling out three 10s and three nines. Could that play a factor in her decision tonight? Just five minutes until the sequin-spangled curtain comes up… News broke this afternoon that Tim Davies has resigned as BBC director general after accusations of bias in news coverage. This sparkly blog probably isn’t the appropriate place to comment but what I would say is just look at the schedules tonight. A David Attenbprough wildlife series, followed by Strixctly, trusty old favourite Antiques Roadshow and Sally Wainwright drama Riot Women. Where else would you get that on an average evening? And that’s just one of the four TV channels. Perhaps we won’t fully appreciate what we’ve got until it’s gone. Tonight’s musical guest is James Morrison. No, I didn’t realise he was still going either. They’ll be booking David Gray, Jack Johnson or Eagle Eye Cherry next. Just ten minutes until showtime… There are growing rumours that Alan Carr - he of the green cloaks, rosé sweats and murders in plain sight - could be one of the potential replacements for outgoing presenters Tess and Claudia. Other names being mentioned on the rumour mill include Holly Willoughby, Zoe Ball, Emma Willis, Fleur East, Rylan Clark and Angela Scanlon. Thoughts? Just 15 minutes until glitter o’clock… The judges are starting to whip their maximums on a more regular basis. Last night we saw six 10s raised - one for Karen Carney’s flat-out Charleston, two for Amber Davies’ disco salsa and three for Vicky Pattison’s fierce tango. It’s 20 minutes until we’re back in the ballroom… Strictly traditionally marks Remembrance Sunday with a poignant group dance and will be doing the same this evening. A lovely traditional ballroom number, I’m told, with the Royal Air Force’s brass band playing in the studio. It’s 25 minutes until we pay our respects… Coming into this weekend, bookmakers’ hot favourites for elimination were Balvinder Sopal and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. Was Balvinder’s vibrant Couples Choice enough to see her rescued from a fourth dance-off by viewer votes? Will Gladiators fans raise their pugil sticks in support of Harry? Half an hour until we get our first clues… Someone’s about to get stuck in the middle. Good evening and welcome to the sixth elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2025. I’m Michael, your choreographic chaperone for tonight’s results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another couple gets sent home, hanging up their dancing shoes at the midway milestone of the contest. Following last night’s high-scoring live show, our nifty nine pro-celebrity pairings will be trimmed down to a excellent eight. The judges’ scores have been combined with viewer votes and tonight the bottom two will dance-off for survival. So who’s in danger of halfway heartbreak? La Voix was left at the foot of the scoreboard, with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Alex Kingston tied at just one point above. There was then a four-point gap to the mid-table George Clarke and Balvinder Sopal. Any of those five could be at risk but will voting viewers agree? If not, we could be in for a dance-off shock. It’s results showtime at the slightly earlier time of 7.10pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 6.40pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ballroom backchat. So snuggle in, keep drinks and nibbles close to hand, and I’ll see you on the sofa. As always, I’d absolutely love to hear from you too. You can tweet/“X” me @michaelhogan, contact me on Bluesky or Threads @michaelhogan100, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for conversational fireworks. I’ll sanba-roll down there whenever I can to eavesdrop on the chat and quote your comments up top. Someone’s going to fall short of Strictly’s home stretch. Nearly time to staaaaaart eliminating! That concludes Saturday’s hot hoofing action but we’ll be back on the ballroom beat tomorrow. The results show airs at the slightly earlier time of 7.10pm Sunday on BBC1. I’ll boot up the blog at 6.40pm for build-up, so I hope you’ll join me then. In the meantime, I’m @michaelhogan on Twitter/X, so please do flerkerl past and say hi, before executing a classic contra check to make Anton go gooey. Thanks for watching along with me and your excellent company. You truly do make my Saturday nights several times shinier. Meet you here tomorrow to see whose name is on the slate to be banished from the ballroom next. In the meantime, whether you’re a Faithful or a Traitor: keeeeeep dancing! And always own up to your nervous farts. Goodnight and god bless. Well, if Shirley can do it with her dance school, so can I. It wouldn’t be a liveblog without a brief plug for my novel, The Dogwalkers’ Detective Agency. It’s a Kindle Monthly Deal for November, meaning the ebook is available for a wag-ulous 99p for a limited time only. You can order here and make a debut author very happy. And thanks to all the lovely commenters already reading and being kind about it. It means a lot from you guys *sheds a tear, Claudia organises a conga to cheer me up* Oh and a nice Celebrity Traitors-themed sign-off from MikeMoonlight: “In a surprising twist, this week’s casting vote will be going to guest judge David Olusoga, who will probably end up saving Ross King.” G1adys says: “I thought this might be Harry’s dance but it was all about muscle-flexing. I’d put it in the dance off with La Voix.” IvanTiger says: “Some good samba steps in there from Harry plus lots of bounce. Liked it. The proper music helped.” MikeMoonlight adds: “Harry is probably one week away from performing the legendary ‘dancing pecs and balloons to cover your modesty’ routine from the 70s and 80s, soundtracked by Joe Loss’s ‘Wheels Cha-cha-Cha’.” Tanya92 says: “I’m thrilled to ribbons with that tango from Vicky and I think the judges will be too.” tomatopincushion says: “Sorry, Vicky &amp; Kai, we were too busy singing along to watch the dance! Swiftie household here.” EnglishAthene says: “Frock of the week! I love teal. Not sure about Kai’s face pulling!” Likeavisionhedances says: “At one point, Kai reminded me of Ted from Gone Fishing!” YodaknowsAll says: “This is the first week I have thought that Vicky has actually partnered Kai as opposed to relying on him. Her best dance for me, with lovely footwork, posture and lines.” GDPD1971 says: “I don’t even mind her screaming because she’s really genuinely excited!” Bianco adds: “Oh knock it off, y’all. Very few people have died of someone else screaming. I’m kind of happy to see someone who clearly hasn’t been told to ‘tone it down’ their whole life.” SaintJulieOfAndrews says: “The wonderful Nikita is far too thrusty these days. He’s putting me off my crisps!” ACSCD1 says: “Amber’s feet touched the floor about 50% of the routine.” The_Scumbrian says: “Blimey, Nikita is flinging her about like it’s Dancing on Ice.” MarkRoche says: “Felt more like a disco showdance than a salsa.” whistledownthewind adds: “God bless Craig for mouthing ‘Too much!’ during Nikita’s groin-thrusting on the judges’ desk. I nearly spat out my Horlicks!” IvanTiger says: “Nice fleckerls from George but his posture’s still not right. Although he’s graceful and has musicality.” 02022020 says: “I loved that from George too, it was proper Viennese travel. Maybe a bit up and down, but what a feeling!” SparklingDormouse says: Like George’s suit! Bit showy for a Viennese but good movement. Would have been better if we could have seen their footwork all the time.” MikeMoonlight adds: “If George suddenly fell ill and couldn’t dance, they could probably get one of his three friends to stand in for him and nobody would notice the difference.” Jamesa0330 says: “I found that Couple’s Choice from Balvinder hugely enjoyable. I normally hate the sympathy dance. It was both thrilling and moving.” ButterflyBlu says: “That was amazing and full of joy from Balvinder. Loved that. Her mum would have been so proud of her ♡.” MollyintheFolly says: “Well, that was amazing. First dance of the night that has entirely kept my attention.” TiggyStardust adds: “We moved from grief in Balvinder’s VT to joy in her dance. I feel really moved. If she’s in the dance-off again, I suggest a riot.” I’ll be right behind you, Tiggy. Bit of a sense of mid-series lull, do we think? Lots of commenters seemed a tad underwhelmed with tonight’s episode. girlpanic says: “I enjoyed that foxtrot from La Voix and Aljaž but I’m not sure how correct the technique was and it didn’t really excite me as much as I wanted it to.” Heartticker says: “Who would not want to dance a foxtrot with Aljaz? It was uplifting and quite joyful.I do love this partnership but the actual dance was just ok at best.” ladyglencora says: “Loving the candy floss hair and sherbet shades in the frock but that foxtrot didn’t quite deliver. Seriously shonky footwork in places.” paperview says: “It was a stroke of genius putting Aljaz and La Voix together. The relationship was a bit rocky at the beginning but the sense of fun and respect for each other has really grown. I know there were problems with that foxtrot but they really appeared to be enjoying dancing together.” Irreverentnurse adds: “‘Flat footed? I held it together but I’m furious.’ Very good. La Voix.” ladyglencora says: “No fireworks for me with Alex’s paso. She seemed to have her tango face on. It needed more passion.” Audreyshandbag says: “Jojo looking like a very expensive cat again and Alex looking gorgeous. Maybe it’s just me but it felt a bit flat.” jagadox says: “Not Alex’s dance but she certainly looked the part.” DotGranville adds: “First time I’ve seen Alex hesitant. She danced in the wrong shoes. Blockier heels and a trap across the instep help flamenco-type footwork. If she’s in the dance-off, she should change shoes. We don’t want to lose her.” Loving that detail, Dot. styletraveller says: “Love Karen’s attitude. She just goes for it and looks as if she is having a ball. Wonderful stuff.” YodaknowsAll says: “Just a touch out of sync in places but what a great Charleston from Karen. Not too sure about the music, mind.” Nerdofhyrule says: “Karen to me is the most likely to win. She’s humble and sweet and getting better all the time. Her jive and Argentine tango are still the best for me.” Jennifera030 says: “Whoever picked Upside Down for a Charleston needs a drug test and their hard drive checked. Ridiculous.” LazyMillennial adds: “I just realised they dressed Karen in the same shade of brown as that infamously awful Coventry strip from the 70s, presumably as a tribute to West Midlands football.” Time to take the temperature of our glittery community’s comments. Bigted1980 says: “What is going on with the music tonight? Nothing seems to go with the choreography.” EdiSteve says: “Is that Shirley mentioning her private lessons for the second week running?” TallulahBankhead says: “I thought Lewis’s cha-cha moves looked just too sharp, to the point of almost looking stiff. Some softness in there would have improved it.” TheMathDiva says: Very entertaining but how much cha-cha was there? Seemed like a lot of Katya showing off and Lewis gyrating around her. Still, Lewis did look a bit fit.” SnailyWhaley adds: “Did Vicky Gill run out of time to make Lewis a proper top? A sparkly unbuttoned shirt would be much better than an M&amp;S vest.” TV viewers can now flip to Sky Max for Wicked: One Wonderful Night, starring Strictly’s own Cynthia Erivo, stay on BBC1 for Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel or head to ITV1 for The 1% Club. At 9pm, choose from The Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance on BBC1 or Girlbands Forever on BBC2. If you fancy a film, tonight’s recommendations are Quiz Show (9pm on Great TV), Midnight Run (9pm on Comedy Central), Gangs Of New York (11.05 pm on Film4). T2: Trainspotting (11.30pm on Channel 4), American Psycho (12.35am on ITV4) and La La Land (12.40am on BBC2). People love what other people are passionate about… Who’s going home with this week’s liveblog baubles? Here are this week’s lucky gong-getters… Best dance: Vicky Pattison’s leaderboard-topping tango. I also loved Balvinder and George. Worst dance: The Latin disappointments from Nitro and Alex Kingston. Best music choice: Taylor Swift and Mama Cass sounded good Worst music choice: That Charleston to a Diana Ross/Aretha Franklin mash-up was a dog’s dinner. Best outfit: Vicky and Alex’s frocks were both stunners. Worst outfit: Amber and Nikita’s disco horrors were distinctly “Carwash night at the student union”. Best VT: An emotional night of VTs, with La Voix and Alex both getting weepy, but the prize goes to Balvinder’s lovely tribute to her late mum. Worst VT: Those “content creators” visiting George in training. Bumfluff moustaches and bad knitwear ahoy. Best judges’ comment: Craig sniped amusingly at Anton all night, saying “there’s nothing there” when he thrusted his groin and telling Motsi that if she tried those lifts with Anton, “you’d end up in hospital”. Best Claudia quip: “That’s more than I needed,” when Katya mentioned beads of Lewis’ sweat landing in her mouth . Also leading a conga to cheer up Alex. Vicky Pattison tops the scoreboard for the first time, with Amber Davies in second spot. La Voix is way down at the bottom, with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Alex Kingston tied just above. As always, though, the public vote plays its part in deciding which two pairs will dance again for survival tomorrow night. It could also be a nervy wait for George Clarke and Balvinder Sopal. “Keeeeeep dancing,” trill Tess and Claud. As the sparkly confetti is swept up by an unassuming janitor who might well be a kung fu-fighting crime-fighter in his spare time, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. This week, the deciding vote in the dance-off goes to… Motsi Mabuse! It’s not been the exciting innovation they thought but let’s keep faith that this format tweak will pay dividends one Sunday. Tonight’s nifty nine routines get rewound on-screen. Which firecrackers are you voting for? Which damp squibs are you definitely not? Online-only, of course. Phonelines are so last season. A fancy-dressed farrago erupts. Nikita lifts Claudia and nearly gives her a hernia. Judges’ scores: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Joint second bottom. Dance-off danger? Judges’ comments: Shirley says “a crowd-pleaser, sensational hip rolls but work on the footwork and knee action”. Anton says “loved your energy, you brought everything and I enjoyed it”. Craig says “happy with the pecs, less so with the rise and fall, needed a softer knee, brought the carnival, intoxicating”. Motsi concludes “felt the rhythm and bounce, you have an aura and bring joy but I want the details”. Sevens and eights, do we think? Harry Aikines-Aryeetey - aka Nitro from Gladiators - finished bottom of the leaderboard last week and was relieved to be lifted clear of the dance-off by viewer votes. Now he’s forgetting such worries and letting loose with a Rio carnival dance. Some dancing pecs to start and then into a rhythmical race-up with hip rotation and bounce action. Controlling his energy, just about, in a bid to nail the samba technique. Harry and pro partner Karen Hauer are bringing the party. A whisk move and plenty of joy. Flagged a bit towards the end and lacking a little musicality maybe, but fluid, supple and fun. Song: Samba by Gloria Estefan. The Latin pop-queen’s Brazilian-flavoured 2020 remake of her classic hit Conga. Judges’ scores: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Top of the leaderboard with one dance to go. Airpunches and leaps of celebration. “It felt like dancing with a professional,” says Kai. Howay the lass. Judges’ comments: Anton says “absolutely marvellous, loved it, compact hold, great line, immaculate, I’m stunned it was so good”. Craig says “your left hand bothered me, apart from that it was perfect”. Motsi says “it proves you’re a contender for the final, dance of the night”. Shirley concludes “belief, narrative, remarkable, I’m with Motsi”. Vicky can’t believe those comment. Thrilled for her. Nines and even a 10 or two? Swifties assemble! Vicky Pattison’s Strictly playlist has been heavy on the pop divas, with Madonna, Bonnie Tyler and Cheryl in recent weeks. Queens all. She’s been the field’s steadiest improver in terms of scores, with last week the first time that she didn’t increase her total. But she’s consistently getting eights now and has become a fixture in mid-table. Kai Widdrington said this week that he thought the tango was her best ballroom dance yet and he might just be right. Flat and fierce in close hold. Regal mood. Slow, stalking promenades with sharp swivels and and clipped staccato. Footwork a little hurried in a couple of places but excellent characterisation and real fire. Loved that. Song: The Fate of Ophelia by Taylor Swift. The lead single from her recent album, The Life Of A Showgirl, is a synth-pop banger inspired by the doomed, drowned Hamlet character. It broke global records for the most-streamed song on Spotify. The lyrics include references to Swift’s relationship with fiancé Travis Kelce, portraying him as an honourable man who saved her from heartbreak and tragedy. Judges’ scores: 9, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 38 points. Her highest score and first 10s, top of the leaderboard as it stands. Amber does some “X Factor phone-hand” on the balcony. Memories of Eoghan Quigg. Just me? Judges’ comments: Shirley says “fluid, flexible, lovely rotation and tricks, great chemistry, really enjoyed it”. Anton makes a lot of noises. Craig says “a-may-zing”. Motsi concludes “absolutely spectacular”. Wow. Nines and 10s en route? The salsa has led to two eliminations this series (Thomas Skinner and Chris Robshaw), so Amber Davies is bidding not to make it a third. All about connection with her partner Nikita Kuzmin. She needs to let herself go to nail the spicy Cuban vibe and energy. Started in a lift, which is unusual, then into a sparkly disco salsa with changes of rhythm. Fast and flirty. She’s been scoring consistently in the mid-30s. Can she start turning those eights and nines into her first 10? Spinning headbanger lift, lacks a little hip action and Latin spice but undoubtedly accomplished and another lift to finish. Song: You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) by Sylvester. The 1978 disco classic and Hi-NRG gay anthem was later covered by Jimmy Somerville and Byron Stingily, whose versions charted in 1989 and 1997 respectively. Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice (remember him?) performed a Strictly salsa to it 10 years ago. Judges’ scores: 8, 8, 9, 9 for a total of 34 points. His highest score. Joint third as it stands. His property presenter namesake will be pleased. Did I see the other George Clarke in the audience? Amazing (spaces). Judges’ comments: Motsi says “you’re back and I’m happy, beautiful atmosphere, used the entire floor, a tiny hop but I love seeing you do ballroom”. Shirley says “back with a bang, some of the best footwork I’ve seen”. Anton says “you shifted, proper dancing, that’s what we’re after, immaculate footwork, we felt the emotion”. Craig concludes “I disagree, footwork not perfect for me, too much rise and fall, got skippy and missed a beat but you’re a strong couple and dance with such ease”. A seven and some nines, are we saying? YouTuber George Clarke and his pro partner Alexis Warr have definitely hit a plateau in the contest. He needs a breakthrough dance and could it be this romantic ballroom number? He needs to believe in himself, embrace the character and not hold back. George looking dapper in a tail suit, which is a welcome change from last week’s terrible Halloween hairpiece. Proper footwork. Breath and flow. Spinning rotation and buttery smooth as they twirl around the floor. This is more like it. Footwork falters in patches but romantic mood and lovely movement. Enjoyed that. Song: Somebody to Love by Queen. The 1976, Aretha Franklin-inspired anthem layered the vocals of Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor to create the impression of a 100-strong gospel choir. It has sountracked two pervious Vienneses on Strictly: Simon Webbe and Kristina Rihanoff’s in 2014, and Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer’s in 2019. Judges’ scores: 7, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 34 points. “The most fun week of my entire dance career,” says Julian. Surely she’ll be safe this week? Judges’ comments: Craig says “totally obsessed with this style of dance but it lacked definition, needed to be cleaner and sharper, but your shaping and timing was superb, you owned that”. Motsi says “your mum is watching and so proud of you, it was feminine and not too hard, controlled details”. Shirley says “your best dance so far, beautiful arms and hands, in your element, Julian killed it too, fantastic team”. Anton concludes “nailed that, more secure than before, a joy”. Always hard to judge a Couple’s Choice but eights and nines, do we reckon? EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal and her pro partner Julian Caillon are now triple dance-off survivors but what better way to fight back than a commercial Couple’s Choice, paying homage to Bal’s Indian roots? They’re both barefoot for this fusion of Bhangra and Bollywood. Balvinder looking lovely in a golden traditional dress. Earthy, grounded, strong and powerful, then switching into some softer, more elegant moves. Vibrant and banging. Lovely side-by-side stuff. Great lifts and hankie-ography. Expressive with bags of energy. Genuinely uplifting. Confetti falls. Yes, Bal! Song: Sapphire by Ed Sheeran &amp; Arijit Singh. This summer’s multilingual, cross-cultural hit fusing pop with Punjabi music was recorded in Goa. Judges’ scores: 6, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 29 points. Bottom as it stands. Judges’ comments: Anton says “uplifting, enjoyed it enormously, heel turns a little home-made and stride pattern got short, try to elongate the backward steps but lovely feel and musicality”. Craig says “left shoulder raised, free arm needs attention and it lacked togetherness but love your exuberant presentation”. Motsi says “I see your new-found love of dance, translate that sunshine into your body, keep on shining”. Shirley concludes “sunshine upstairs, raining downstairs, a bit flat-footed and out of sync but always a joy to watch”. Sevens and eights? Drag queen La Voix joined the 30s club with last week’s Queen Of Hearts paso doble, by far her best dance. Can she maintain momentum while going from power to softness? She hasn’t done ballroom for four weeks but the foxtrot is partner Aljaž Škorjanec’s favourite dance. Lying down on the dancefloor to start. Woodstock hippy vibes in a shimmery rainbow frock. Gliding, flowing and fluid. Topline wobbles and posture not perfect with the odd bit of gapping. Lacks a little smoothness but petals fall and high performance value as always. Lovely. Song: Make Your Own Kind of Music by Cass Elliot. The 1969 bubblegum pop anthem by Mama Cass featured prominently in plane crash drama Lost. It was later covered by Paloma Faith of “murdered in plain sight by Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors” fame *touches face with poison pollen*. Judges’ scores: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Alex is weepy but gets a group hug on the Clauditorium. Judges’ comments: Motsi says “the first time I’ve felt insecurity from you but you move like a queen, come back and show us your fire”. Shirley says “stumbled on a few steps but technicalities were fantastic elsewhere, lacked passion, fire and spatial awareness”. Anton says “regal, well-schooled and studious but looked a little nervous”. Craig concludes “tense shoulders, lacked shaping, too placed and careful, lacked showbiz pizzazz, too middle-of-the-road”. Sevens incoming? Alex Kingston has excelled at Latin so far, with her rumba, salsa and samba all scoring highly. Now she and pro partner Johannes Radebe are telling the story of the bullfight, clad in black lacy outfits. Imperious characterisation. Packed with content and traditional steps. Great chemistry. Fiery and passionate, as you’d expect from an actor who always brings the drama. She’s been working hard in training on that contorted banana shape but those curved Spanish lines are a little lacking. Flat-footed at times but powerful and punchy. A high-class paso, if not a spicy one. Song: Amparito Roca by Jaime Teixidor. The famous 1925 piece, named after one of the composer’s 12-year-old piano students. McFly’s Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden also performed a paso to it during the 2021 series. Judges’ scores: 8, 10 (woah!), 8, 9 for a total of 35 points. Same as Lewis. Carlos says it’s the most difficult routine he’s ever done on Strictly. Judges’ comments: Craig says “a right little bobby-dazzler, incredible, could’ve done more swivel and lifts got sticky but your energy was amazing”. Motsi says “dynamic and on-top, naturally expressive, I love you”. Shirley says “fast-paced and difficult but swivelling was a little missing and off-balance in places but lots to like”. Anton concludes “congratulations to Carlos for keeping up, lindhop part tremendous”. Eights and nines? I’ve been looking forward to this. Former Lioness Karen Carney, riding high after scorting her first 10s for last week’s Peaky Blinders-capped Argentine tango, should have the sporty stamina and fast feet required here. Her pro partner Carlos Gu’s previous Charlestons have scored 35 and 38 points. No pressure. Gimmicky upside-down opening, then into a quirky, happy dance packed with lifts, tricks, flicks and kicks. Loads of steps and bounce. Cute outfits, with Karen in “skorts”, braces and blouse. Craig “Swivel” Horwood will have a beady eye on those ankles. Out of sync at times and a little messy in the upper body. Giving it welly, fast as hell but not quite gellling for me. Song: Upside Down/Think by Diana Ross/Aretha Franklin. A funky mash-up of the Niles Rodgers-produced 1980 disco classic and the 1968 soul anthem which was famously featured on The Blues Brothers soundtrack. Judges’ scores: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Setting a high bar for the next eight couples. Judges’ comments: Shirley says “I like it like that, well-balanced, did a grand job”. Anton says “he’s barely out of breath and barely dressed, timing and fluidity brilliant, a little bit hard in the base”. Craig says “a little try-hard and hit the shapes too hard but insane rhythm and hips on fire”. Motsi concludes “I loved it like that, cool Cuban vibe”. Nines ahoy? Vest-clad actor Lewis Cope goes from Hartlepool to Havana. Last week’s triumphant Couple’ Choice scored a perfect 40 (only the second ever maximum for pro partner Katya Jones) and was hailed as one of the best dances in Strictly history. A lot to live up to, so the technically tricky Cuban party dance could see Lewis come crashing back to earth – or perhaps not. Lots of exposing solo work which he handles with style. Low, deep and grounded down below. More fluid and free in the upper body. Cheeky, flirty feel with wiggling hip action. A large helping of Cuban sauce. Man, he’s good. Katya clearly loving having a great partner. Phew, a spicy start to the show. Song: I Like It Like That by Pete Rodriguez. The 1967 boogaloo hit was covered in the 90s by Latin supergroup The Blackout All-Stars version. Its use in a Burger King ad also contributed to its resurgence in popularity, More recently, it was sampled by rapper Cardi B (full name: Cardigan Buttons). Our couples come out for a staircase welcome wave. Nitro’s got his pecs out. So has Aussie Julian. Some singalong air-punching to Bon Jovi, oddly. We welcome the paddle-raisibng panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke. All in black, with Shirley’s frock oddly matronly. They raised six 10s last week. Will we see any maximums tonight? Here’s our presentational dream duo, so let’s do the traditional frock-off. Tess Daly is a sparkly black halterneck frock. Claudia Winkleman is in a black sequinned shirt and trousers with white stilettoes. Claud wins, like a sort of couture Alan Carr. Which of these grinning couples will be falling at the halfway hurdle? Roll the industry standard scene-setting VT. Split or shaft? Sorry, wrong show. Close your curtains on any fireworks and concentrate on the dance pyrotechnics instead. We’re about to be rocketed over live to Elstree Studios… Amanda Holden-hosted quiz The Celebrity Inner Circle just wrapping up on BBC1. I’ve been subjected to six episodes of this now and am still none the wiser about the rules. A mere five minutes to wait now… For the first time this series, there are no overlaps, so we’ll be treated to nine different styles tonight, including a Charleston from Karen Carney and a Bollywood-flavoured Couple’s Choice from Balvinder Sopal. Not long now until the glitterball starts spinning… Sad news today that former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson has died aged 68 after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He occupies a place in Strictly history, of course, although not a terribly illustrious one. After being partnered with Hazel Newberry in the second series, he was eliminated first and his eight-point cha-cha still stands as the lowest score ever awarded by the judges. Perhaps dear departed Len Goodman can give him lessons up in dance heaven. It’s 10 minutes until the spangly curtain comes up…. Tick them off when you spot them! Take a drink for each! Wind up handcuffed to a confused policeman in Amsterdam! Here’s tonight’s 10-point spotter’s checklist: The judges have no idea how to mark a Couple’s Choice so make it up as they go along Craig Revel Horwood insists that a Charleston isn’t quirky or swivelly enough Struggling celebrity plays the cute kid/nanna card in their VT Shirley Ballas mentions footwork details and “fundamentals” Lewis Cope unconvincingly denies that scoring a perfect 40 last week raised pressure or expectations Anton du Beke coos over a classic ballroom number and says it’s the sort of routine he would’ve loved to dance Vicky Pattison’s post-dance interview involves mention of her nerves/an animal reference Motsi Mabuse pretty much tells Craig to shut up and stop nitpicking The newly eliminated Vito Coppola becomes chief cheerleader on the balcony Dave Arch’s band do well with a classic tune but make a right mess of a contemporary pop banger News this week that beloved Strictly pro Amy Dowden will sit out the rest of the series after undergoing a second mastectomy. The 35-year-old from Caerphilly was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023 after discovering a lump in her breast during her honeymoon. She has reassured fans that the latest operation wasn’t related to a new diagnosis and that she’s “looking forward to rejoining the Strictly family” when her health has improved. We wish her well with her recovery. It’s 20 minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune… Perhaps unsurprisingly, Balvinder Sopal and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey are the bookies’ tips for the bottom two this week, followed - slightly more surprisingly - by Amber Davies. Can this endangered trio defy the odds? It’s 25 minutes until we get our first choreographic clues… Someone won’t make it past the midway mark. Good evening and welcome to the seventh live weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2025. I’m Michael, your virtual dance partner for tonight’s mercifully non-themed live show. You are warmly invited to watch along with me as our nine remaining couples reach the halfway point of the contest. Last week’s Halloween Spooktacular saw some spookily high scoring. Lewis Cope got the first perfect 40 of the series for his stunning Couple’s Choice and Karen Carney also scored two 10s for her Peaky Blinders-themed Argentine tango. Down the bottom Balvinder Sopal was consigned to her third dance-off but Ellie Goldstein was sadly eliminated. Tonight the nine surviving pro-celebrity pairings take to the floor again, bidding to get past the midway point and enter Strictly’s home stretch. Yes, it’s all downhill from here until Christmas. It’s showtime at 6.25pm on BBC One. I’ll be liveblogging from 5.55pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ooh-aah verbal fireworks. So light a sparkler on the hob, get your teeth stuck in a toffee apple and I’ll see you on the sofa. As ever, I’d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, contact me on Bluesky or Threads @michaelhogan100, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for choreographic conversation. I’ll samba-bounce down there whenever I can to see what you’re all saying and quote your sage words up top. So please don’t be shy about sharing your thoughts.

Our surviving eight pairs now progress to the eighth live show, which sees them bidding to make it through to the Blackpool Tower Ballroom special. Yes, the other B-word will soon be bandied about more than Brexit. It airs at next Saturday at the same time of 6.25pm on BBC1. Meet you back here to see who deserves to be beside the seaside, beside the sea. In the meantime, you know what to do: keeeeep dancing! Nighty-night and have a good week. JimJayuu says: \\u201cThat was a tight decision alright. I admit a bit of bias here but I did think La Voix was slightly better in the dance-off and obviously the inclusion of the much discussed heel turn in her dance may have just swung it to her. Next week is going to be interesting because she may benefit from a \\u2018get La Voix to Blackpool\\u2019 vote, which then potentially leaves Balvinder and Amber at risk. It is getting harder and harder to call these.\\u201d Finally, Tanya92 adds: \\u201cAw, I\\u2019m sad to see Harry go, although happy to have another week of Alivoix. The whole cast are so good and seem like a lovely bunch of people. Can we keep them all from here on?\\u201d Diamondcat says: \\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t agree. I really did think Harry was better but there you go. I think La Voix will be out next week.\\u201d TheMathDiva says: \\u201cHarry is a lovely, genuine bloke. Nice exit speech.\\u201d EdiSteve says: \\u201cWell that\\u2019s a daft result, Harry was loads better in the dance-off. La Voix was worse than in the first show, lots of wobbly walking, while Harry shimmied marvelously.\\u201d MikeMoonlight adds: \\u201cSo it\\u2019s farewell to Harry. It\\u2019s good that the current young generation have one of the new TV Gladiators as a role model. I\\u2019m sure they will take him to their hearts and minds with the same passion and vigour that a previous generation of teenagers took to Jet in the 90s! Oh, hang on a minute...\\u201d Fihema says: \\u201cJames Morrison is reminding me of an in-tune Rod Stewart.\\u201d VictoriasSecret says: \\u201cReally pleased that we get a little more La Voix. Both couples are both a bit adrift of the overall stranded, but La Voix is entertaining every week and I want a little bit more.\\u201d irreverentnurse says: \\u201cI\\u2019ll cut your hair, George. I do my own sometimes. My husband calls it self-harming behaviour when I do. It can go either way.\\u201d Somersetlass says: \\u201cOK, given the scores, these are the correct couples in the dance-off. So relieved Alex is through. As I wasn\\u2019t able to vote last night, the guilt would have been unbearable.\\u201d Strictlylounging adds: \\u201cMr Lounging, who is an ex-military musician, has just said that this brass band are regarded as one of the best in the military music world. He said it grudgingly, because they\\u2019re RAF, but high praise indeed!\\u201d Somersetlass says: \\u201cWhat a beautiful Children In Need segment on This Is Us and Christopher. His mum\\u2019s not the only one who\\u2019s welling up.\\u201d LazyMillennial says: \\u201cAs a neurodivergent, I just wish I had the same support and understanding as this young man growing up. There are sometimes reasons to be happy about the future.\\u201d Time for a rapid-fire round-up of your comments. lester48 says: \\u201cGet Craig on next year\\u2019s Celebrity Traitors.\\u201d TeeDubyaBee says: \\u201cDave Arch clearly got the \\u2018more cowbell\\u2019 memo from Christopher Walken.\\u201d Lidoswimmer says: \\u201cSurely Dave Arch deserves some kind of statue\\/plaque\\/bank holiday?\\u201d jagadox adds: You never know what\\u2019s going to be in the woods here. Worse, dashing out across the road driving at nigh. What\\u2019s that? Sodding hell, it\\u2019s a wild boar. They can really mess up your car and it doesn\\u2019t do the pig much good either.\\u201d TV viewers can now stay on BBC1 for Antiques Roadshow, flip to ITV1 for the Bullseye reboot, head to Channel 4 for Game Of Wool: Britain\\u2019s Best Knitter or for more hoofing fun, it\\u2019s Dance Night over on BBC4 - kicking off with Dance Passion Bradford, before a rerun of Matthew Bourne\\u2019s Swan Lake introduced by Sir Matthew himself. At 9pm, choose from new drama Trespasses on Channel 4, Riot Women on BBC1, Trigger Point on ITV1, Hunted on Channel 4 or Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing on BBC2. Film recommendations, you say? I\\u2019m glad you asked. Tonight there\\u2019s The Day of the Jackal (9pm on Legend Xtra), Lethal Weapon (9pm on ITV4), My Best Friend\\u2019s Wedding (10.40pm on E4), 1917 (10.50pm on BBC2) and Stand By Me (11.10pm on Film4). I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone? Two other celebrities will be counting their lucky stars tonight. Alex Kingston might have topped the leaderboard twice but she seriously struggled with the paso doble and plummeted down to second bottom. She will be relieved she never has to do that dance again. Alex was looking like a potential finalist but if she doesn\\u2019t bounce back next time, those hopes might dwindle. Meanwhile, George Clarke improved on his recent form with his Viennese waltz but in a fast-improving field, he has become mid-table fodder. The YouTuber was another tip for the final who has taken a dip. George needs to start turning up the wow factor if he\\u2019s going to dance into December. EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal feared the worst way back in week three when she appeared in the bottom two. Yet five weekends and three dance-offs later, she deservedly lives to dance another day. It\\u2019s testament to her pluck, hard work and how pro partner Julian Caillon has helped keep her spirits up. Last night\\u2019s joyous Punjabi-spiced Couple\\u2019s Choice was her best performance yet. If she can carry that confidence forward and tackle every dance style with the same expressive enjoyment, Ballroom Bal might just defy the bookies for another few weeks. In her 14th series, Strictly\\u2019s longest-serving pro landed her most promising celebrity partner for five years. Venezuelan-born firecracker Karen Hauer clearly relished teaming up with athlete Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, who was capable of flinging her around and even doing press-ups with Karen standing on his back. Those lifts during their Lion King salsa in Movie Week looked almost effortless. Karen also got to perform her first Argentine tango in 13 years and a rumba which had the judges coming over all a-flutter about their chemistry. Since reaching the 2020 final with Jamie Laing, she\\u2019d fallen into an uncanny pattern of finishing 12th every series - with Greg Wise, Jayde Adams, Eddie Kadi and Paul Merson, in chronological order. Coming ninth with Harry is her longest run for some time. Karen was at risk of becoming the female Anton du Beke, saddled with the early leavers. Start your engines. The Drag Race runner-up managed to rev herself up and overtake her rival when it mattered. La Voix finished bottom of the Saturday night scoreboard, one point below Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. Yet when they competed in the dance-off, she not only closed the gap but outshone him sufficiently to earn a unanimous judges\\u2019 decision. An impressive result from an experienced performer who knows how to turn it on \\u2013 not to mention do a heel lead right in front of the judges\\u2019 table. She\\u2019s still the lowest average scorer left in the contest and looks like she could be dance-off fodder on a more regular basis now. La Voix always brings the entertainment factor - not least with her pre-dance skits and post-dance quips to the judges - but the longer the contest goes on, the harder they will clamp down on technique. Time for her and Alja\\u017e \\u0160korjanec to really knuckle down in training. She needs to go from La Voix to La Danse or she could soon sashay away. He had potential to last another week or two but it\\u2019s hard to argue that Harry Aikines-Aryeetey didn\\u2019t deserve to be eliminated. His form has dipped in recent weeks, with his bizarre space-themed, silver foil-clad American smooth in Halloween week leaving him bottom of the leaderboard. Last night\\u2019s samba was a slight improvement but still left him a single point off the bottom. In a high-quality field \\u2013 this was the closest ever week seven scoreboard, with just 10 points separating top from bottom - a few mistakes and two lacklustre weeks on the trot proved fatal. He failed to raise his game enough for the dance-off and was left in the glittery dust by La Voix. At least the Olympian and Gladiators star bowed out with a broad smile and a party dance. His samba might have lacked technical precision but it was joyous and celebratory. A fitting end because his full-beam energy lit up the contest. His dancing pecs and rippling six-pack had a few admirers, too. Harry struggled with control at times - partner Karen Hauer said trying to rein him in was like \\u201ctrying to put a brake on a stallion\\u201d - but he brought charisma, sparkle and swagger to every routine. His highlights were his spicy Lion King salsa (those lifts!) and his sensual Argentine tango (that sizzle!). Now Nitro packed up his pugil stick and boarded the big travelator home. Another one bites the dust. As the eliminated pair take a farewell turn around the ballroom to Against All Odds by Phil Collins (tune), their castmates crowd in for cuddles and the credits roll. Please stay with us for analysis and reaction. Harry\\u2019s partner Karen says: \\u201cI am extremely proud of Harry. We\\u2019ve had the best time. You\\u2019re such a gentleman, you\\u2019re a hard worker. I loved you in every kind of way because of the person that you are. I was an honour to teach you, so thank you so much.\\u201d She\\u2019s a good\\u2019un, that Hotlips Hauer. In his exit interview with Tess Daly, Harry says: \\u201cFirst of all, I just want to thank Karen. Genuinely, you have given me an opportunity to shine. You\\u2019ve understood my crazy brain. I\\u2019m such a logical person, obviously doing what I do - Olympic sprinter, Gladiator - now I was trying to be a dancer. I just want to thank you so much for the time and effort, the hard work that you\\u2019ve put into me. You show up, you turn out. I want to thank everyone here. Literally, this has been a dream come true. This is a celebration. I spoke to my daughter and when she saw me sad last week, she was like, \\u2018Daddy what\\u2019s wrong?\\u2019 I wanted to show everyone that, no matter what happens, there\\u2019s always a silver lining. This has been an experience for me. So thank you for this lovely gift. At the end of the day, we carry on, we give it to them and we continue to shine. Do you know what I mean?\\u201d Um, sort of. But well said, Harry. Her casting vote wasn\\u2019t needed but Motsi would also have saved La Voix and Alja\\u017e. There it is. The Gladiators star and Olympic sprinter becomes the sixth celebrity to be eliminated and the seventh overall to depart the Strictly 2025 dancefloor. La Voix and Alja\\u017e, saying \\u201cevenly matched but for their improvement\\u201d. La Voix and Alja\\u017e, saying \\u201cboth danced better but because of her musicality\\u201d. La Voix and Alja\\u017e, saying \\u201cboth couples improved but for clarity of technique\\u201d. Over to the paddle-raising panel. They all scored both couples the same last night except Craig, who scored Harry one point more than La Voix. Have they seen anything to change their minds? They will go on our first whistle. Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Karen Hauer have another go at their show-closing samba to Samba by Gloria Estefan. The judges said last night that it was a crowd-pleaser with bounce and rhythm but he needed to work on his feet and knees. Can Harry soften them second time around? It scored 30 points, only one more than La Voix, so he needs to be on his AA-game. La Voix and Alja\\u017e \\u0160korjanec reprise their foxtrot to Make Your Own Kind of Music by Cass Elliot. The judges said last night that uplifting and joyous but her heel turns were \\u201ca little home-made\\u201d, her stride pattern got short, her left shoulder raised and it was flat-footed. Otherwise, perfect! It scored 29 points, just one fewer than Harry, so this will be a close call. Can La Voix raise her game, slip in that crucial heel lead and close the gap? Musical interlude now from husky-voiced rock-soul troubadour James Morrison, performing Fight Another Day - the title track from his recent top five album. Choreographic accompaniment is provided by Jowita Pryzsta\\u0142 and Neil Jones. The Polish pocket rocket and the ginger ninja, together at last. Kids have been imitating their Couple\\u2019s Choice moves on TikTok, apparently. Claudia looks suitably baffled. They\\u2019re dancing a tango next week. More balcony badinage with the relieved pairs. Alex Kingston tells us about Johannes Radebe\\u2019s phobia of English woodland. They geed themselves up this week with Ride On Time by Black Box. Banger. The last two pairs puff out of their cheeks and progress to next week. Well, she was bottom of the scoreboard so perhaps\\u2019s that\\u2019s no surprise. La Voix and her pro partner Alja\\u017e \\u0160korjanec are also in the dance-off for the first time. Gladiator ready? Pro partner ready? Harry and Karen Hauer are consigned to the dreaded dance-off for the first time. But who will they be up against? Now to find out who else is safely through to week eight - and who might not be. Hold me, Bubble. Simple, heartfelt and elegant. A reminder that more of these group numbers should be trad ballroom, rather than try-hard gimmicky affairs. It\\u2019s what Strictly does best. Choreographed by the excellent Matt Flint, it\\u2019s a fittingly old-fashioned ballroom number with dancing in formation and lots of lifts. Time for a poignant group number from the Strictly professionals to honour the courage, dedication and sacrifice of our Armed Forces. Joined by the Band of the Royal Air Force Regiment, it\\u2019s set to Sam Fender\\u2019s Remember My Name. We begin with Lauren Oakley and Alja\\u017e \\u0160korjanec creating a lovely atmosphere, before the rest of the pro troupe join in. Claudia tees up a compilation of \\u201cher husband\\u201d Dave Arch playing a succession of instruments last night. No wonder they\\u2019re so happily married. Motsi pays tribute to Vicky\\u2019s tango and its clarity of performance. Thrilled to ribbons. Shirley Ballas praises Balvinder and Julian\\u2019s Couple\\u2019s Choice. Anton loved Amber and Nikita\\u2019s seamless lifts, then demonstrates one with Shirley. Strictly\\u2019s Health &amp; Safety officer just had a minor seizure. The paddle-raising panel sashay up to the Clauditorium for some Cake By The Ocean and a closer peek at last night\\u2019s routines. Craig discusses Alex Kingston\\u2019s paso doble problems. A lovely VT now about 16-year-old Strictly superfan Christopher, who has autism and had his life transformed the This Is Us Dance company, supported by Children In Need. He got to meet Nikita and Anton, his favourites, and was shown around the Elstree ballrom. Keep dancing, Christopher. Amber and Nikita are dancing a paso doble to Dream On next week. Not two. Wise. Although the second bunny is in her sights too. That all clear? Good. Salt and vinegar is her preference. She and George Clarke are dancing to Keane\\u2019s Somewhere Only We Know next week. She\\u2019s spent most of this week googling somebody called Linda Hop. I think I was at school with her. She came down from Leeds for a supportive cuddle. Up in the Clauditorium with the five relieved couples who are safely through to next week, Balvinder Sopal also pays tribute to partner Julian Caillon embracing her Punjabi culture for last night\\u2019s Couple\\u2019s Choice. Also returning to the dancefloor are Balvinder Sopal, Vicky Pattison, George Clarke and Karen Carney. Stand by, the scarlet spotlight of doom is about to be switched on at the Elstree mains. Our nine couples wait to hear their fates. Flutterbies in their stomachs, I\\u2019ll wager. The paddle-raising panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Anton Du Beke and Shirley Ballas take their seats. Hope Craig and Anton have kissed and made up. They seemed a bit snippy with one another last night, no? A rewind of Saturday night\\u2019s routines on-screen now. Vicky\\u2019s tango tops the scores! Amber\\u2019s feet barely touch the floor! Balvinder busts out Punjabi moves! Carlos tries to keep up with Karen! Here\\u2019s our presenting pair so let\\u2019s do a rig-out reckoning. Tess Daly is in a white halterneck jumpsuit. Claudia Winkleman is in a long skirt with button-and-cuff details. Tess wins, making it one-all this weekend. Fair. Which of these smiling couples will soon be wheeling their suitcase to the taxi of tears? Roll a backstage VT from last night. Frocks! Fake tan! Cameras! A distinct lack of shirt buttons! Action! Email just in from Iain in Montreal: Awaiting the results of last night\\u2019s show, I can\\u2019t help but feel the biggest thing missing was the cheerful exuberance of Ellie Goldstein\\u2019s partnership with Vito. I\\u2019m as partial to a dancing pectoral a la Harry as anyone, but they are readily found on the internet if one ever feels the need. The joyous feel-good factor of Ellie and Vito\\u2019s performances is unique and greatly missed. Buckle up, fleckerl fans. We\\u2019re about to return to the Elstree Studios ballroom\\u2026 New wildlife series Kingdom just drawing to a close on BBC1 right now. This David Attenborough-narrated six-parter follows four rival families \\u2013 leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions \\u2013 trying to claim a corner of Zambia as their home. It\\u2019s basically a furry Game of Thrones. Not long to wait now\\u2026 It was announced in last night\\u2019s live show that this week\\u2019s decisive dance-off vote goes to judge Motsi Mabuse. She was the most generous with her scoring last night, doling out three 10s and three nines. Could that play a factor in her decision tonight? Just five minutes until the sequin-spangled curtain comes up\\u2026 News broke this afternoon that Tim Davies has resigned as BBC director general after accusations of bias in news coverage. This sparkly blog probably isn\\u2019t the appropriate place to comment but what I would say is just look at the schedules tonight. A David Attenbprough wildlife series, followed by Strixctly, trusty old favourite Antiques Roadshow and Sally Wainwright drama Riot Women. Where else would you get that on an average evening? And that\\u2019s just one of the four TV channels. Perhaps we won\\u2019t fully appreciate what we\\u2019ve got until it\\u2019s gone. Tonight\\u2019s musical guest is James Morrison. No, I didn\\u2019t realise he was still going either. They\\u2019ll be booking David Gray, Jack Johnson or Eagle Eye Cherry next. Just ten minutes until showtime\\u2026 There are growing rumours that Alan Carr - he of the green cloaks, ros\\u00e9 sweats and murders in plain sight - could be one of the potential replacements for outgoing presenters Tess and Claudia. Other names being mentioned on the rumour mill include Holly Willoughby, Zoe Ball, Emma Willis, Fleur East, Rylan Clark and Angela Scanlon. Thoughts? Just 15 minutes until glitter o\\u2019clock\\u2026 The judges are starting to whip their maximums on a more regular basis. Last night we saw six 10s raised - one for Karen Carney\\u2019s flat-out Charleston, two for Amber Davies\\u2019 disco salsa and three for Vicky Pattison\\u2019s fierce tango. It\\u2019s 20 minutes until we\\u2019re back in the ballroom\\u2026 Strictly traditionally marks Remembrance Sunday with a poignant group dance and will be doing the same this evening. A lovely traditional ballroom number, I\\u2019m told, with the Royal Air Force\\u2019s brass band playing in the studio. It\\u2019s 25 minutes until we pay our respects\\u2026 Coming into this weekend, bookmakers\\u2019 hot favourites for elimination were Balvinder Sopal and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey. Was Balvinder\\u2019s vibrant Couples Choice enough to see her rescued from a fourth dance-off by viewer votes? Will Gladiators fans raise their pugil sticks in support of Harry? Half an hour until we get our first clues\\u2026 Someone\\u2019s about to get stuck in the middle. Good evening and welcome to the sixth elimination of Strictly Come Dancing 2025. I\\u2019m Michael, your choreographic chaperone for tonight\\u2019s results show. You are cordially invited to watch along with me as another couple gets sent home, hanging up their dancing shoes at the midway milestone of the contest. Following last night\\u2019s high-scoring live show, our nifty nine pro-celebrity pairings will be trimmed down to a excellent eight. The judges\\u2019 scores have been combined with viewer votes and tonight the bottom two will dance-off for survival. So who\\u2019s in danger of halfway heartbreak? La Voix was left at the foot of the scoreboard, with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Alex Kingston tied at just one point above. There was then a four-point gap to the mid-table George Clarke and Balvinder Sopal. Any of those five could be at risk but will voting viewers agree? If not, we could be in for a dance-off shock. It\\u2019s results showtime at the slightly earlier time of 7.10pm on BBC One. I\\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.40pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ballroom backchat. So snuggle in, keep drinks and nibbles close to hand, and I\\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\\u2019d absolutely love to hear from you too. You can tweet\\/\\u201cX\\u201d me @michaelhogan, contact me on Bluesky or Threads @michaelhogan100, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for conversational fireworks. I\\u2019ll sanba-roll down there whenever I can to eavesdrop on the chat and quote your comments up top. Someone\\u2019s going to fall short of Strictly\\u2019s home stretch. Nearly time to staaaaaart eliminating! That concludes Saturday\\u2019s hot hoofing action but we\\u2019ll be back on the ballroom beat tomorrow. The results show airs at the slightly earlier time of 7.10pm Sunday on BBC1. I\\u2019ll boot up the blog at 6.40pm for build-up, so I hope you\\u2019ll join me then. In the meantime, I\\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter\\/X, so please do flerkerl past and say hi, before executing a classic contra check to make Anton go gooey. Thanks for watching along with me and your excellent company. You truly do make my Saturday nights several times shinier. Meet you here tomorrow to see whose name is on the slate to be banished from the ballroom next. In the meantime, whether you\\u2019re a Faithful or a Traitor: keeeeeep dancing! And always own up to your nervous farts. Goodnight and god bless. Well, if Shirley can do it with her dance school, so can I. It wouldn\\u2019t be a liveblog without a brief plug for my novel, The Dogwalkers\\u2019 Detective Agency. It\\u2019s a Kindle Monthly Deal for November, meaning the ebook is available for a wag-ulous 99p for a limited time only. You can order here and make a debut author very happy. And thanks to all the lovely commenters already reading and being kind about it. It means a lot from you guys *sheds a tear, Claudia organises a conga to cheer me up* Oh and a nice Celebrity Traitors-themed sign-off from MikeMoonlight: \\u201cIn a surprising twist, this week\\u2019s casting vote will be going to guest judge David Olusoga, who will probably end up saving Ross King.\\u201d G1adys says: \\u201cI thought this might be Harry\\u2019s dance but it was all about muscle-flexing. I\\u2019d put it in the dance off with La Voix.\\u201d IvanTiger says: \\u201cSome good samba steps in there from Harry plus lots of bounce. Liked it. The proper music helped.\\u201d MikeMoonlight adds: \\u201cHarry is probably one week away from performing the legendary \\u2018dancing pecs and balloons to cover your modesty\\u2019 routine from the 70s and 80s, soundtracked by Joe Loss\\u2019s \\u2018Wheels Cha-cha-Cha\\u2019.\\u201d Tanya92 says: \\u201cI\\u2019m thrilled to ribbons with that tango from Vicky and I think the judges will be too.\\u201d tomatopincushion says: \\u201cSorry, Vicky &amp; Kai, we were too busy singing along to watch the dance! Swiftie household here.\\u201d EnglishAthene says: \\u201cFrock of the week! I love teal. Not sure about Kai\\u2019s face pulling!\\u201d Likeavisionhedances says: \\u201cAt one point, Kai reminded me of Ted from Gone Fishing!\\u201d YodaknowsAll says: \\u201cThis is the first week I have thought that Vicky has actually partnered Kai as opposed to relying on him. Her best dance for me, with lovely footwork, posture and lines.\\u201d GDPD1971 says: \\u201cI don\\u2019t even mind her screaming because she\\u2019s really genuinely excited!\\u201d Bianco adds: \\u201cOh knock it off, y\\u2019all. Very few people have died of someone else screaming. I\\u2019m kind of happy to see someone who clearly hasn\\u2019t been told to \\u2018tone it down\\u2019 their whole life.\\u201d SaintJulieOfAndrews says: \\u201cThe wonderful Nikita is far too thrusty these days. He\\u2019s putting me off my crisps!\\u201d ACSCD1 says: \\u201cAmber\\u2019s feet touched the floor about 50% of the routine.\\u201d The_Scumbrian says: \\u201cBlimey, Nikita is flinging her about like it\\u2019s Dancing on Ice.\\u201d MarkRoche says: \\u201cFelt more like a disco showdance than a salsa.\\u201d whistledownthewind adds: \\u201cGod bless Craig for mouthing \\u2018Too much!\\u2019 during Nikita\\u2019s groin-thrusting on the judges\\u2019 desk. I nearly spat out my Horlicks!\\u201d IvanTiger says: \\u201cNice fleckerls from George but his posture\\u2019s still not right. Although he\\u2019s graceful and has musicality.\\u201d 02022020 says: \\u201cI loved that from George too, it was proper Viennese travel. Maybe a bit up and down, but what a feeling!\\u201d SparklingDormouse says: Like George\\u2019s suit! Bit showy for a Viennese but good movement. Would have been better if we could have seen their footwork all the time.\\u201d MikeMoonlight adds: \\u201cIf George suddenly fell ill and couldn\\u2019t dance, they could probably get one of his three friends to stand in for him and nobody would notice the difference.\\u201d Jamesa0330 says: \\u201cI found that Couple\\u2019s Choice from Balvinder hugely enjoyable. I normally hate the sympathy dance. It was both thrilling and moving.\\u201d ButterflyBlu says: \\u201cThat was amazing and full of joy from Balvinder. Loved that. Her mum would have been so proud of her \\u2661.\\u201d MollyintheFolly says: \\u201cWell, that was amazing. First dance of the night that has entirely kept my attention.\\u201d TiggyStardust adds: \\u201cWe moved from grief in Balvinder\\u2019s VT to joy in her dance. I feel really moved. If she\\u2019s in the dance-off again, I suggest a riot.\\u201d I\\u2019ll be right behind you, Tiggy. Bit of a sense of mid-series lull, do we think? Lots of commenters seemed a tad underwhelmed with tonight\\u2019s episode. girlpanic says: \\u201cI enjoyed that foxtrot from La Voix and Alja\\u017e but I\\u2019m not sure how correct the technique was and it didn\\u2019t really excite me as much as I wanted it to.\\u201d Heartticker says: \\u201cWho would not want to dance a foxtrot with Aljaz? It was uplifting and quite joyful.I do love this partnership but the actual dance was just ok at best.\\u201d ladyglencora says: \\u201cLoving the candy floss hair and sherbet shades in the frock but that foxtrot didn\\u2019t quite deliver. Seriously shonky footwork in places.\\u201d paperview says: \\u201cIt was a stroke of genius putting Aljaz and La Voix together. The relationship was a bit rocky at the beginning but the sense of fun and respect for each other has really grown. I know there were problems with that foxtrot but they really appeared to be enjoying dancing together.\\u201d Irreverentnurse adds: \\u201c\\u2018Flat footed? I held it together but I\\u2019m furious.\\u2019 Very good. La Voix.\\u201d ladyglencora says: \\u201cNo fireworks for me with Alex\\u2019s paso. She seemed to have her tango face on. It needed more passion.\\u201d Audreyshandbag says: \\u201cJojo looking like a very expensive cat again and Alex looking gorgeous. Maybe it\\u2019s just me but it felt a bit flat.\\u201d jagadox says: \\u201cNot Alex\\u2019s dance but she certainly looked the part.\\u201d DotGranville adds: \\u201cFirst time I\\u2019ve seen Alex hesitant. She danced in the wrong shoes. Blockier heels and a trap across the instep help flamenco-type footwork. If she\\u2019s in the dance-off, she should change shoes. We don\\u2019t want to lose her.\\u201d Loving that detail, Dot. styletraveller says: \\u201cLove Karen\\u2019s attitude. She just goes for it and looks as if she is having a ball. Wonderful stuff.\\u201d YodaknowsAll says: \\u201cJust a touch out of sync in places but what a great Charleston from Karen. Not too sure about the music, mind.\\u201d Nerdofhyrule says: \\u201cKaren to me is the most likely to win. She\\u2019s humble and sweet and getting better all the time. Her jive and Argentine tango are still the best for me.\\u201d Jennifera030 says: \\u201cWhoever picked Upside Down for a Charleston needs a drug test and their hard drive checked. Ridiculous.\\u201d LazyMillennial adds: \\u201cI just realised they dressed Karen in the same shade of brown as that infamously awful Coventry strip from the 70s, presumably as a tribute to West Midlands football.\\u201d Time to take the temperature of our glittery community\\u2019s comments. Bigted1980 says: \\u201cWhat is going on with the music tonight? Nothing seems to go with the choreography.\\u201d EdiSteve says: \\u201cIs that Shirley mentioning her private lessons for the second week running?\\u201d TallulahBankhead says: \\u201cI thought Lewis\\u2019s cha-cha moves looked just too sharp, to the point of almost looking stiff. Some softness in there would have improved it.\\u201d TheMathDiva says: Very entertaining but how much cha-cha was there? Seemed like a lot of Katya showing off and Lewis gyrating around her. Still, Lewis did look a bit fit.\\u201d SnailyWhaley adds: \\u201cDid Vicky Gill run out of time to make Lewis a proper top? A sparkly unbuttoned shirt would be much better than an M&amp;S vest.\\u201d TV viewers can now flip to Sky Max for Wicked: One Wonderful Night, starring Strictly\\u2019s own Cynthia Erivo, stay on BBC1 for Michael McIntyre\\u2019s The Wheel or head to ITV1 for The 1% Club. At 9pm, choose from The Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance on BBC1 or Girlbands Forever on BBC2. If you fancy a film, tonight\\u2019s recommendations are Quiz Show (9pm on Great TV), Midnight Run (9pm on Comedy Central), Gangs Of New York (11.05 pm on Film4). T2: Trainspotting (11.30pm on Channel 4), American Psycho (12.35am on ITV4) and La La Land (12.40am on BBC2). People love what other people are passionate about\\u2026 Who\\u2019s going home with this week\\u2019s liveblog baubles? Here are this week\\u2019s lucky gong-getters\\u2026 Best dance: Vicky Pattison\\u2019s leaderboard-topping tango. I also loved Balvinder and George. Worst dance: The Latin disappointments from Nitro and Alex Kingston. Best music choice: Taylor Swift and Mama Cass sounded good Worst music choice: That Charleston to a Diana Ross\\/Aretha Franklin mash-up was a dog\\u2019s dinner. Best outfit: Vicky and Alex\\u2019s frocks were both stunners. Worst outfit: Amber and Nikita\\u2019s disco horrors were distinctly \\u201cCarwash night at the student union\\u201d. Best VT: An emotional night of VTs, with La Voix and Alex both getting weepy, but the prize goes to Balvinder\\u2019s lovely tribute to her late mum. Worst VT: Those \\u201ccontent creators\\u201d visiting George in training. Bumfluff moustaches and bad knitwear ahoy. Best judges\\u2019 comment: Craig sniped amusingly at Anton all night, saying \\u201cthere\\u2019s nothing there\\u201d when he thrusted his groin and telling Motsi that if she tried those lifts with Anton, \\u201cyou\\u2019d end up in hospital\\u201d. Best Claudia quip: \\u201cThat\\u2019s more than I needed,\\u201d when Katya mentioned beads of Lewis\\u2019 sweat landing in her mouth . Also leading a conga to cheer up Alex. Vicky Pattison tops the scoreboard for the first time, with Amber Davies in second spot. La Voix is way down at the bottom, with Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and Alex Kingston tied just above. As always, though, the public vote plays its part in deciding which two pairs will dance again for survival tomorrow night. It could also be a nervy wait for George Clarke and Balvinder Sopal. \\u201cKeeeeeep dancing,\\u201d trill Tess and Claud. As the sparkly confetti is swept up by an unassuming janitor who might well be a kung fu-fighting crime-fighter in his spare time, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. This week, the deciding vote in the dance-off goes to\\u2026 Motsi Mabuse! It\\u2019s not been the exciting innovation they thought but let\\u2019s keep faith that this format tweak will pay dividends one Sunday. Tonight\\u2019s nifty nine routines get rewound on-screen. Which firecrackers are you voting for? Which damp squibs are you definitely not? Online-only, of course. Phonelines are so last season. A fancy-dressed farrago erupts. Nikita lifts Claudia and nearly gives her a hernia. Judges\\u2019 scores: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Joint second bottom. Dance-off danger? Judges\\u2019 comments: Shirley says \\u201ca crowd-pleaser, sensational hip rolls but work on the footwork and knee action\\u201d. Anton says \\u201cloved your energy, you brought everything and I enjoyed it\\u201d. Craig says \\u201chappy with the pecs, less so with the rise and fall, needed a softer knee, brought the carnival, intoxicating\\u201d. Motsi concludes \\u201cfelt the rhythm and bounce, you have an aura and bring joy but I want the details\\u201d. Sevens and eights, do we think? Harry Aikines-Aryeetey - aka Nitro from Gladiators - finished bottom of the leaderboard last week and was relieved to be lifted clear of the dance-off by viewer votes. Now he\\u2019s forgetting such worries and letting loose with a Rio carnival dance. Some dancing pecs to start and then into a rhythmical race-up with hip rotation and bounce action. Controlling his energy, just about, in a bid to nail the samba technique. Harry and pro partner Karen Hauer are bringing the party. A whisk move and plenty of joy. Flagged a bit towards the end and lacking a little musicality maybe, but fluid, supple and fun. Song: Samba by Gloria Estefan. The Latin pop-queen\\u2019s Brazilian-flavoured 2020 remake of her classic hit Conga. Judges\\u2019 scores: 9, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 39 points. Top of the leaderboard with one dance to go. Airpunches and leaps of celebration. \\u201cIt felt like dancing with a professional,\\u201d says Kai. Howay the lass. Judges\\u2019 comments: Anton says \\u201cabsolutely marvellous, loved it, compact hold, great line, immaculate, I\\u2019m stunned it was so good\\u201d. Craig says \\u201cyour left hand bothered me, apart from that it was perfect\\u201d. Motsi says \\u201cit proves you\\u2019re a contender for the final, dance of the night\\u201d. Shirley concludes \\u201cbelief, narrative, remarkable, I\\u2019m with Motsi\\u201d. Vicky can\\u2019t believe those comment. Thrilled for her. Nines and even a 10 or two? Swifties assemble! Vicky Pattison\\u2019s Strictly playlist has been heavy on the pop divas, with Madonna, Bonnie Tyler and Cheryl in recent weeks. Queens all. She\\u2019s been the field\\u2019s steadiest improver in terms of scores, with last week the first time that she didn\\u2019t increase her total. But she\\u2019s consistently getting eights now and has become a fixture in mid-table. Kai Widdrington said this week that he thought the tango was her best ballroom dance yet and he might just be right. Flat and fierce in close hold. Regal mood. Slow, stalking promenades with sharp swivels and and clipped staccato. Footwork a little hurried in a couple of places but excellent characterisation and real fire. Loved that. Song: The Fate of Ophelia by Taylor Swift. The lead single from her recent album, The Life Of A Showgirl, is a synth-pop banger inspired by the doomed, drowned Hamlet character. It broke global records for the most-streamed song on Spotify. The lyrics include references to Swift\\u2019s relationship with fianc\\u00e9 Travis Kelce, portraying him as an honourable man who saved her from heartbreak and tragedy. Judges\\u2019 scores: 9, 10, 9, 10 for a total of 38 points. Her highest score and first 10s, top of the leaderboard as it stands. Amber does some \\u201cX Factor phone-hand\\u201d on the balcony. Memories of Eoghan Quigg. Just me? Judges\\u2019 comments: Shirley says \\u201cfluid, flexible, lovely rotation and tricks, great chemistry, really enjoyed it\\u201d. Anton makes a lot of noises. Craig says \\u201ca-may-zing\\u201d. Motsi concludes \\u201cabsolutely spectacular\\u201d. Wow. Nines and 10s en route? The salsa has led to two eliminations this series (Thomas Skinner and Chris Robshaw), so Amber Davies is bidding not to make it a third. All about connection with her partner Nikita Kuzmin. She needs to let herself go to nail the spicy Cuban vibe and energy. Started in a lift, which is unusual, then into a sparkly disco salsa with changes of rhythm. Fast and flirty. She\\u2019s been scoring consistently in the mid-30s. Can she start turning those eights and nines into her first 10? Spinning headbanger lift, lacks a little hip action and Latin spice but undoubtedly accomplished and another lift to finish. Song: You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) by Sylvester. The 1978 disco classic and Hi-NRG gay anthem was later covered by Jimmy Somerville and Byron Stingily, whose versions charted in 1989 and 1997 respectively. Georgia May Foote and Giovanni Pernice (remember him?) performed a Strictly salsa to it 10 years ago. Judges\\u2019 scores: 8, 8, 9, 9 for a total of 34 points. His highest score. Joint third as it stands. His property presenter namesake will be pleased. Did I see the other George Clarke in the audience? Amazing (spaces). Judges\\u2019 comments: Motsi says \\u201cyou\\u2019re back and I\\u2019m happy, beautiful atmosphere, used the entire floor, a tiny hop but I love seeing you do ballroom\\u201d. Shirley says \\u201cback with a bang, some of the best footwork I\\u2019ve seen\\u201d. Anton says \\u201cyou shifted, proper dancing, that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re after, immaculate footwork, we felt the emotion\\u201d. Craig concludes \\u201cI disagree, footwork not perfect for me, too much rise and fall, got skippy and missed a beat but you\\u2019re a strong couple and dance with such ease\\u201d. A seven and some nines, are we saying? YouTuber George Clarke and his pro partner Alexis Warr have definitely hit a plateau in the contest. He needs a breakthrough dance and could it be this romantic ballroom number? He needs to believe in himself, embrace the character and not hold back. George looking dapper in a tail suit, which is a welcome change from last week\\u2019s terrible Halloween hairpiece. Proper footwork. Breath and flow. Spinning rotation and buttery smooth as they twirl around the floor. This is more like it. Footwork falters in patches but romantic mood and lovely movement. Enjoyed that. Song: Somebody to Love by Queen. The 1976, Aretha Franklin-inspired anthem layered the vocals of Freddie Mercury, Brian May and Roger Taylor to create the impression of a 100-strong gospel choir. It has sountracked two pervious Vienneses on Strictly: Simon Webbe and Kristina Rihanoff\\u2019s in 2014, and Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer\\u2019s in 2019. Judges\\u2019 scores: 7, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 34 points. \\u201cThe most fun week of my entire dance career,\\u201d says Julian. Surely she\\u2019ll be safe this week? Judges\\u2019 comments: Craig says \\u201ctotally obsessed with this style of dance but it lacked definition, needed to be cleaner and sharper, but your shaping and timing was superb, you owned that\\u201d. Motsi says \\u201cyour mum is watching and so proud of you, it was feminine and not too hard, controlled details\\u201d. Shirley says \\u201cyour best dance so far, beautiful arms and hands, in your element, Julian killed it too, fantastic team\\u201d. Anton concludes \\u201cnailed that, more secure than before, a joy\\u201d. Always hard to judge a Couple\\u2019s Choice but eights and nines, do we reckon? EastEnders actor Balvinder Sopal and her pro partner Julian Caillon are now triple dance-off survivors but what better way to fight back than a commercial Couple\\u2019s Choice, paying homage to Bal\\u2019s Indian roots? They\\u2019re both barefoot for this fusion of Bhangra and Bollywood. Balvinder looking lovely in a golden traditional dress. Earthy, grounded, strong and powerful, then switching into some softer, more elegant moves. Vibrant and banging. Lovely side-by-side stuff. Great lifts and hankie-ography. Expressive with bags of energy. Genuinely uplifting. Confetti falls. Yes, Bal! Song: Sapphire by Ed Sheeran &amp; Arijit Singh. This summer\\u2019s multilingual, cross-cultural hit fusing pop with Punjabi music was recorded in Goa. Judges\\u2019 scores: 6, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 29 points. Bottom as it stands. Judges\\u2019 comments: Anton says \\u201cuplifting, enjoyed it enormously, heel turns a little home-made and stride pattern got short, try to elongate the backward steps but lovely feel and musicality\\u201d. Craig says \\u201cleft shoulder raised, free arm needs attention and it lacked togetherness but love your exuberant presentation\\u201d. Motsi says \\u201cI see your new-found love of dance, translate that sunshine into your body, keep on shining\\u201d. Shirley concludes \\u201csunshine upstairs, raining downstairs, a bit flat-footed and out of sync but always a joy to watch\\u201d. Sevens and eights? Drag queen La Voix joined the 30s club with last week\\u2019s Queen Of Hearts paso doble, by far her best dance. Can she maintain momentum while going from power to softness? She hasn\\u2019t done ballroom for four weeks but the foxtrot is partner Alja\\u017e \\u0160korjanec\\u2019s favourite dance. Lying down on the dancefloor to start. Woodstock hippy vibes in a shimmery rainbow frock. Gliding, flowing and fluid. Topline wobbles and posture not perfect with the odd bit of gapping. Lacks a little smoothness but petals fall and high performance value as always. Lovely. Song: Make Your Own Kind of Music by Cass Elliot. The 1969 bubblegum pop anthem by Mama Cass featured prominently in plane crash drama Lost. It was later covered by Paloma Faith of \\u201cmurdered in plain sight by Alan Carr on The Celebrity Traitors\\u201d fame *touches face with poison pollen*. Judges\\u2019 scores: 7, 8, 7, 8 for a total of 30 points. Alex is weepy but gets a group hug on the Clauditorium. Judges\\u2019 comments: Motsi says \\u201cthe first time I\\u2019ve felt insecurity from you but you move like a queen, come back and show us your fire\\u201d. Shirley says \\u201cstumbled on a few steps but technicalities were fantastic elsewhere, lacked passion, fire and spatial awareness\\u201d. Anton says \\u201cregal, well-schooled and studious but looked a little nervous\\u201d. Craig concludes \\u201ctense shoulders, lacked shaping, too placed and careful, lacked showbiz pizzazz, too middle-of-the-road\\u201d. Sevens incoming? Alex Kingston has excelled at Latin so far, with her rumba, salsa and samba all scoring highly. Now she and pro partner Johannes Radebe are telling the story of the bullfight, clad in black lacy outfits. Imperious characterisation. Packed with content and traditional steps. Great chemistry. Fiery and passionate, as you\\u2019d expect from an actor who always brings the drama. She\\u2019s been working hard in training on that contorted banana shape but those curved Spanish lines are a little lacking. Flat-footed at times but powerful and punchy. A high-class paso, if not a spicy one. Song: Amparito Roca by Jaime Teixidor. The famous 1925 piece, named after one of the composer\\u2019s 12-year-old piano students. McFly\\u2019s Tom Fletcher and Amy Dowden also performed a paso to it during the 2021 series. Judges\\u2019 scores: 8, 10 (woah!), 8, 9 for a total of 35 points. Same as Lewis. Carlos says it\\u2019s the most difficult routine he\\u2019s ever done on Strictly. Judges\\u2019 comments: Craig says \\u201ca right little bobby-dazzler, incredible, could\\u2019ve done more swivel and lifts got sticky but your energy was amazing\\u201d. Motsi says \\u201cdynamic and on-top, naturally expressive, I love you\\u201d. Shirley says \\u201cfast-paced and difficult but swivelling was a little missing and off-balance in places but lots to like\\u201d. Anton concludes \\u201ccongratulations to Carlos for keeping up, lindhop part tremendous\\u201d. Eights and nines? I\\u2019ve been looking forward to this. Former Lioness Karen Carney, riding high after scorting her first 10s for last week\\u2019s Peaky Blinders-capped Argentine tango, should have the sporty stamina and fast feet required here. Her pro partner Carlos Gu\\u2019s previous Charlestons have scored 35 and 38 points. No pressure. Gimmicky upside-down opening, then into a quirky, happy dance packed with lifts, tricks, flicks and kicks. Loads of steps and bounce. Cute outfits, with Karen in \\u201cskorts\\u201d, braces and blouse. Craig \\u201cSwivel\\u201d Horwood will have a beady eye on those ankles. Out of sync at times and a little messy in the upper body. Giving it welly, fast as hell but not quite gellling for me. Song: Upside Down\\/Think by Diana Ross\\/Aretha Franklin. A funky mash-up of the Niles Rodgers-produced 1980 disco classic and the 1968 soul anthem which was famously featured on The Blues Brothers soundtrack. Judges\\u2019 scores: 8, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Setting a high bar for the next eight couples. Judges\\u2019 comments: Shirley says \\u201cI like it like that, well-balanced, did a grand job\\u201d. Anton says \\u201che\\u2019s barely out of breath and barely dressed, timing and fluidity brilliant, a little bit hard in the base\\u201d. Craig says \\u201ca little try-hard and hit the shapes too hard but insane rhythm and hips on fire\\u201d. Motsi concludes \\u201cI loved it like that, cool Cuban vibe\\u201d. Nines ahoy? Vest-clad actor Lewis Cope goes from Hartlepool to Havana. Last week\\u2019s triumphant Couple\\u2019 Choice scored a perfect 40 (only the second ever maximum for pro partner Katya Jones) and was hailed as one of the best dances in Strictly history. A lot to live up to, so the technically tricky Cuban party dance could see Lewis come crashing back to earth \\u2013 or perhaps not. Lots of exposing solo work which he handles with style. Low, deep and grounded down below. More fluid and free in the upper body. Cheeky, flirty feel with wiggling hip action. A large helping of Cuban sauce. Man, he\\u2019s good. Katya clearly loving having a great partner. Phew, a spicy start to the show. Song: I Like It Like That by Pete Rodriguez. The 1967 boogaloo hit was covered in the 90s by Latin supergroup The Blackout All-Stars version. Its use in a Burger King ad also contributed to its resurgence in popularity, More recently, it was sampled by rapper Cardi B (full name: Cardigan Buttons). Our couples come out for a staircase welcome wave. Nitro\\u2019s got his pecs out. So has Aussie Julian. Some singalong air-punching to Bon Jovi, oddly. We welcome the paddle-raisibng panel of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke. All in black, with Shirley\\u2019s frock oddly matronly. They raised six 10s last week. Will we see any maximums tonight? Here\\u2019s our presentational dream duo, so let\\u2019s do the traditional frock-off. Tess Daly is a sparkly black halterneck frock. Claudia Winkleman is in a black sequinned shirt and trousers with white stilettoes. Claud wins, like a sort of couture Alan Carr. Which of these grinning couples will be falling at the halfway hurdle? Roll the industry standard scene-setting VT. Split or shaft? Sorry, wrong show. Close your curtains on any fireworks and concentrate on the dance pyrotechnics instead. We\\u2019re about to be rocketed over live to Elstree Studios\\u2026 Amanda Holden-hosted quiz The Celebrity Inner Circle just wrapping up on BBC1. I\\u2019ve been subjected to six episodes of this now and am still none the wiser about the rules. A mere five minutes to wait now\\u2026 For the first time this series, there are no overlaps, so we\\u2019ll be treated to nine different styles tonight, including a Charleston from Karen Carney and a Bollywood-flavoured Couple\\u2019s Choice from Balvinder Sopal. Not long now until the glitterball starts spinning\\u2026 Sad news today that former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson has died aged 68 after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He occupies a place in Strictly history, of course, although not a terribly illustrious one. After being partnered with Hazel Newberry in the second series, he was eliminated first and his eight-point cha-cha still stands as the lowest score ever awarded by the judges. Perhaps dear departed Len Goodman can give him lessons up in dance heaven. It\\u2019s 10 minutes until the spangly curtain comes up\\u2026. Tick them off when you spot them! Take a drink for each! Wind up handcuffed to a confused policeman in Amsterdam! Here\\u2019s tonight\\u2019s 10-point spotter\\u2019s checklist: The judges have no idea how to mark a Couple\\u2019s Choice so make it up as they go along Craig Revel Horwood insists that a Charleston isn\\u2019t quirky or swivelly enough Struggling celebrity plays the cute kid\\/nanna card in their VT Shirley Ballas mentions footwork details and \\u201cfundamentals\\u201d Lewis Cope unconvincingly denies that scoring a perfect 40 last week raised pressure or expectations Anton du Beke coos over a classic ballroom number and says it\\u2019s the sort of routine he would\\u2019ve loved to dance Vicky Pattison\\u2019s post-dance interview involves mention of her nerves\\/an animal reference Motsi Mabuse pretty much tells Craig to shut up and stop nitpicking The newly eliminated Vito Coppola becomes chief cheerleader on the balcony Dave Arch\\u2019s band do well with a classic tune but make a right mess of a contemporary pop banger News this week that beloved Strictly pro Amy Dowden will sit out the rest of the series after undergoing a second mastectomy. The 35-year-old from Caerphilly was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023 after discovering a lump in her breast during her honeymoon. She has reassured fans that the latest operation wasn\\u2019t related to a new diagnosis and that she\\u2019s \\u201clooking forward to rejoining the Strictly family\\u201d when her health has improved. We wish her well with her recovery. It\\u2019s 20 minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\\u2026 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Balvinder Sopal and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey are the bookies\\u2019 tips for the bottom two this week, followed - slightly more surprisingly - by Amber Davies. Can this endangered trio defy the odds? It\\u2019s 25 minutes until we get our first choreographic clues\\u2026 Someone won\\u2019t make it past the midway mark. Good evening and welcome to the seventh live weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2025. I\\u2019m Michael, your virtual dance partner for tonight\\u2019s mercifully non-themed live show. You are warmly invited to watch along with me as our nine remaining couples reach the halfway point of the contest. Last week\\u2019s Halloween Spooktacular saw some spookily high scoring. Lewis Cope got the first perfect 40 of the series for his stunning Couple\\u2019s Choice and Karen Carney also scored two 10s for her Peaky Blinders-themed Argentine tango. Down the bottom Balvinder Sopal was consigned to her third dance-off but Ellie Goldstein was sadly eliminated. Tonight the nine surviving pro-celebrity pairings take to the floor again, bidding to get past the midway point and enter Strictly\\u2019s home stretch. Yes, it\\u2019s all downhill from here until Christmas. It\\u2019s showtime at 6.25pm on BBC One. I\\u2019ll be liveblogging from 5.55pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and ooh-aah verbal fireworks. So light a sparkler on the hob, get your teeth stuck in a toffee apple and I\\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As ever, I\\u2019d love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, contact me on Bluesky or Threads @michaelhogan100, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for choreographic conversation. I\\u2019ll samba-bounce down there whenever I can to see what you\\u2019re all saying and quote your sage words up top. So please don\\u2019t be shy about sharing your thoughts. It\\u2019s week seven and we\\u2019re going to hoofing heaven. Nearly time to staaaart halfway dancing!\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/arts\",\"pillarName\":\"Arts\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL);

(179, 62, 8, 'football/2025/nov/09/guardiola-thanks-doku-and-manchester-city-for-present-of-liverpool-victory', 'Guardiola thanks Doku and Manchester City for ‘present’ of Liverpool victory', 'Pep Guardiola brought up 1,000 games as manager against Liverpool, whose head coach Arne Slot was unhappy with Virgil van Dijk’s disallowed goal', 'Pep Guardiola praised Jérémy Doku and thanked Manchester City for giving him the “incredible present” of a 3-0 victory against Liverpool, in his 1,000th match as a manager. First-half goals from Erling Haaland and Nico González and an outstanding 20-yard individual Doku effort after the break took City to within four points of the Premier League leaders Arsenal. As half-time neared, Virgil van Dijk’s header was ruled out after Andy Robertson, standing in front of the City goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, was adjudged to have interfered with play. This was Guardiola’s 716th career victory and the former Bayern Munich and Barcelona manager said: “Thank you to the players and staff for giving me an incredible present against the most important opponent we faced in my time here. It has been a special night with my kids here.” Of Doku, Guardiola said: “I think he will never be a top scorer, to be honest, but he’s demanding himself to be better, he listens, and has special attributes of dribbling. He was aggressive with and without the ball. We tried to help him and he played an outstanding game.” Guardiola, for whom this was a 550th game as City’s manager, was asked about Arsenal dropping two points at Sunderland on Saturday. “I think Liverpool and us said: ‘Oh wow, Arsenal dropped points finally and conceded two goals.’ But I said to the players not to do it because yesterday Arsenal didn’t win. Do it because we believe in ourselves that we can play against the champions of England and show them we are ready to be there with them this season. Today we proved it – especially in the first half.” Liverpool’s defeat was the champions’ fifth in their past six league games. Arne Slot was asked to assess the number in the context of their title defence. “It feels as if there are too many,” the manager said. “The last thing we should think about is the title race and we should focus on getting result after result after result as we are seventh or eighth. The best time to judge the league table is after 38 but the next best is after 19 when everyone has played the same opponent.” Slot was asked about Van Dijk’s disallowed header, ruled out after Andy Robertson was adjudged to be offside and interfering with play. “It is obvious and clear that the wrong decision has been made. He [Robertson] didn’t interfere at all with what the goalkeeper could do,” the manager said. The Dutchman said that the referee, Chris Kavanagh, awarded John Stones’s goal for City in the 2-1 win against Wolves last season when Bernardo Silva was in a similar zone in front of the Wolves goalkeeper José Sá.

First-half goals from Erling Haaland and Nico Gonz\\u00e1lez and an outstanding 20-yard individual Doku effort after the break took City to within four points of the Premier League leaders Arsenal. As half-time neared, Virgil van Dijk\\u2019s header was ruled out after Andy Robertson, standing in front of the City goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, was adjudged to have interfered with play. This was Guardiola\\u2019s 716th career victory and the former Bayern Munich and Barcelona manager said: \\u201cThank you to the players and staff for giving me an incredible present against the most important opponent we faced in my time here. It has been a special night with my kids here.\\u201d Of Doku, Guardiola said: \\u201cI think he will never be a top scorer, to be honest, but he\\u2019s demanding himself to be better, he listens, and has special attributes of dribbling. He was aggressive with and without the ball. We tried to help him and he played an outstanding game.\\u201d Guardiola, for whom this was a 550th game as City\\u2019s manager, was asked about Arsenal dropping two points at Sunderland on Saturday. \\u201cI think Liverpool and us said: \\u2018Oh wow, Arsenal dropped points finally and conceded two goals.\\u2019 But I said to the players not to do it because yesterday Arsenal didn\\u2019t win. Do it because we believe in ourselves that we can play against the champions of England and show them we are ready to be there with them this season. Today we proved it \\u2013 especially in the first half.\\u201d Liverpool\\u2019s defeat was the champions\\u2019 fifth in their past six league games. Arne Slot was asked to assess the number in the context of their title defence. \\u201cIt feels as if there are too many,\\u201d the manager said. \\u201cThe last thing we should think about is the title race and we should focus on getting result after result after result as we are seventh or eighth. The best time to judge the league table is after 38 but the next best is after 19 when everyone has played the same opponent.\\u201d Slot was asked about Van Dijk\\u2019s disallowed header, ruled out after Andy Robertson was adjudged to be offside and interfering with play. \\u201cIt is obvious and clear that the wrong decision has been made. He [Robertson] didn\\u2019t interfere at all with what the goalkeeper could do,\\u201d the manager said. The Dutchman said that the referee, Chris Kavanagh, awarded John Stones\\u2019s goal for City in the 2-1 win against Wolves last season when Bernardo Silva was in a similar zone in front of the Wolves goalkeeper Jos\\u00e9 S\\u00e1.

The post also made it a point to call people against tariffs “FOOLS!” For such a plan to take effect, congressional approval would likely be required. Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing $600 in tariff rebates for nearly all Americans and their dependent children. “Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would “allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country”. However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration’s main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt – not to give rebate checks to Americans. According to the treasury department’s September report, $195bn in customs duties were collected during the first three quarters of the year. Though, it appears that the cost of giving out $2,000 checks could easily surpass the amount actually collected from the tariffs. According to calculations, these payments would cost close to if not more than double the amount that has reportedly been generated so far. “If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion,” wrote Erica York, vice-president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, on social media. “If kids qualify, that grows.” “The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs”, York added. “Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump’s proposed $300 billion rebate.” John Arnold, co-chair of Arnold Ventures, estimated that the dividend payments could cost as much as $513bn. As of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from the Yale Budget Lab. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers. This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. In October, he said that he was considering offering Americans checks from the revenue, worth somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. In July, the president again suggested that the government might consider tariff rebate checks. In February, he and tech mogul Elon Musk, who at the time was still advising the White House, said they were considering the idea of a $5,000 “dividend” check based on savings generated by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge).

With these resignations, it has given in', 'The corporation should have stood up to the Telegraph, Trump and the Tories. Now, its enemies know how little it takes for it to fold, says Jane Martinson, professor of financial journalism', 'The resignation of the BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, over accusations of bias comes as a shock and leaves a gulf at the top of the corporation when it needs leadership most. Davie stressed that the decision was his alone – neither the board, nor even many of those who led the coordinated attack among rightwing press and politicians expected it. Now the resignations of both Davie and the CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results. The biggest shock is that this saga began just a week ago with the leak of a 19-page “devastating memo” from Michael Prescott, a former political journalist who spent three years as an external adviser to the broadcaster, published in the Telegraph. The dossier alleges BBC Panorama doctored a speech by Trump, making him appear to support the January 6 rioters, that its Arabic coverage privileged pro-Hamas views, and that a group of LGBTQ employees had excessive influence on coverage of sex and gender. The Telegraph wrote that the BBC’s very silence “proves there is a serious problem”. Meanwhile, the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s “blast” at Nick Robinson, the only BBC staffer to publicly fight back against the accusations, leads the Mail on Sunday, and Donald Trump’s press secretary has called the BBC “100% fake news” Leave to one side for now the direct allegations about specific failures of BBC coverage, and the BBC’s own baffling inability or unwillingness to defend itself over the past week. But the row obscures the context that explains what is, at the heart of the matter, a political campaign against the BBC that could act as a textbook example of how to confuse and undermine the kind of journalism that is, at the very least, aiming for impartiality in a sea of spin and distortion. Prescott stresses he has never been a member of a political party and that his views “do not come with any political agenda” in the introduction to his 8,000-word note. Yet each criticism of BBC coverage comes from the anti-progressive culture-war playbook. For example, he is “shocked” that after an hour-long Panorama documentary dealing with Trump and the January 6 insurgency, there was no “similar, balancing” programme about the Democrat presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. As someone who has spent years dealing with the issue of impartiality told me, this is an entirely wrongheaded and now discredited view of impartiality, the sort of view that led to airtime being given to climate denial. Prescott also accuses the BBC of amplifying “issues of racism”. Yet his own argument and suggested source material undermines his own claims of neutrality. He cites a 2022 report by History Reclaimed, also published in the Telegraph, which highlights four BBC programmes with “an overly simplistic and distorted narrative about British colonial racism, slave-trading and its legacy”. While some of its members are senior Oxbridge academics, History Reclaimed’s website makes clear that the group was formed to counter “culture war” narratives in the media that suggest British history is shameful. Prescott remains “mystified” that his requests for BBC producers and editors to meet the report’s authors were ignored. Yet in its own review at the time, the BBC concluded that History Reclaimed “cherrypicking a handful of examples or highlighting genuine mistakes in thousands of hours of output on TV and radio does not constitute analysis and is not a true representation of BBC content”. Sadly, there has been no corresponding BBC response to the rehashed criticism in Prescott’s own extensive review of past complaints. None of this is to say that the BBC has not made mistakes. At the very least, the Panorama documentary appears to have included a bad and misleading edit of an hour-long Trump speech, which is unacceptable even if that speech was subsequently found to have encouraged insurrection. The BBC is expected to apologise on Monday over the Trump edit. That should have been enough. Prescott’s 10 years as chief political correspondent and then political editor of the Sunday Times must have also helped his laser focus on two issues in particular that have divided even the BBC’s biggest supporters. Its reporting in Gaza, specifically that of the BBC Arabic service – given greater prominence recently not just because of the war but because of cuts in BBC News – has wounded many in the Jewish community, while the BBC’s handling of trans rights has divided even its own staff. Yet pity the BBC that, while tiptoeing not always gracefully through these editorial minefields with thousands of hours of content, it has also to deal with enemies from within. Concerns about an apparent conflict of interest were raised when Johnson appointed Prescott to advise Ofcom over its new chair four years ago. Prescott, whose PR firm Hanover was involved in advising media companies such as Sky, has also been described as a friend of Robbie Gibb, a former Conservative government head of communications who joined the BBC board after helping to launch the rightwing news channel GB News. However, Prescott was allowed to continue in that role, and a government spokesperson said on Prescott’s behalf that the appointment was “fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest”. He was later appointed external adviser to the BBC standards board. Gibb himself is understood to have written a long and critical note about BBC coverage to the board in early September, a few weeks before Prescott. BBC sources tell me that the chair, Samir Shah, immediately ordered Peter Johnston, the director of editorial complaints and reviews, to work on a response and a briefing was discussed at the board on 16 October. So why has the BBC so far said nothing, apart from letting it be known that Shah is likely to apologise for the Trump edit when called to respond to the culture, media and sport committee tomorrow? Given the sheer volume of the content it airs and criticism it receives, the BBC can sometimes be forgiven for not wanting to stir passions further. But by spending days insisting that it did not comment on “leaked documents”, the corporation has simply looked weak and cowardly, just when it needs to be robust and brave. October Films, the independent production company that made the Trump Panorama, is said to be working on a film about Nigel Farage. With many of the criticisms already looked at and addressed internally, should it really take so long to come out with a response? These are difficult times for the BBC. About to enter into negotiations to renew its charter after more than a decade of licence-fee cuts, it is also caught in political and economic headwinds. Johnson’s threat to cancel his licence fee comes after 300,000 more households did so over the past year. Trump’s threat of a lawsuit against the BBC follows his successful cowing of the US media, with a succession of commercial broadcasters agreeing to pay damages on the flimsiest of charges. The BBC must be independent of government and political interference. But to do that, it needs the trust of everyone who pays for its services. In his resignation letter, Davie pleads for a better future after 20 years at an organisation he loves. “We should champion [the BBC],” he writes. “Not weaponise it.” It feels as if this plea is already too late.

Insiders say it ‘feels like a coup’ by broadcaster’s enemies', 'Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, and the head of BBC News have resigned after a former adviser to the corporation accused it of “serious and systemic” bias in its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights. In an announcement that caused shock within the corporation, Davie said his departure was “entirely my decision” and it comes as the BBC prepares to apologise for the way it edited a Trump speech. Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News, has also resigned. Sources within that department described a mood of dismay at Turness’s exit. “It feels like a coup,” one said. “This is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.” It is a huge moment for the corporation, as it heads into critical talks with the government over its future and funding. The hunt is now on to fill two of the biggest roles in British media. The Commons culture, media and sport select committee had set a Monday deadline for the BBC to respond to the claims made by Michael Prescott, a former independent external adviser to its editorial guidelines and standards committee. He left that role in the summer. Prescott criticised the editing of Trump’s speech in an edition of Panorama, which spliced together clips from an address the US president made on 6 January 2021. The edit suggested Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart. The incident has led to criticism of the BBC by Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, who described the corporation this weekend as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”. Last night, Leavitt appeared to celebrate the departures, referring on X to her complaints about the BBC’s treatment of the US president’s speech. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that “very dishonest people” had “tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election”, adding: “On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for democracy!” In a note to staff, Davie said he had retained the “unswerving and unanimous support” of the BBC’s board and its chair, Samir Shah, throughout. However, he said the current accusations had contributed to his decision. “Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable,” he said. “While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility.” Davie’s departure comes after a torrid year in which the BBC has been criticised over the comments of its former presenter Gary Lineker, the livestreaming of a Glastonbury festival performance of the rap punk duo Bob Vylan, and criticisms over a Gaza documentary. The departures of Davie and Turness appear to be an attempt to protect the BBC from further attacks following Prescott’s criticisms, which he made in a letter to the BBC’s board. Shah said Davie’s departure was a “sad day” for the BBC. “He has had the full support of me and the board throughout,” he said. “However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.” The Prescott letter, which was passed to the Daily Telegraph, also condemned BBC Arabic for using contributors who had expressed antisemitic views. It included the views of a contributor who had previously stated online that Jews should be burned “as Hitler did”. The BBC has previously said he should not have been featured in the way he was. Another featured contributor had described Jews online as “devils”. The BBC said in May that the person had been barred from being a contributor in future. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, had said she was confident that Shah and Davie were “treating this with the seriousness that this demands”. In her departure note to staff, Turness said: “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love. “As the CEO of BBC News and current affairs, the buck stops with me. In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down.” However, she used her departure statement to push back on Prescott’s allegations of general bias at the corporation. “While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,” she said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the corporation needs “to turn a new leaf”, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, called for “top-to-bottom” reform and Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, said it was the BBC’s “last chance”. While many BBC figures believe Prescott’s letter refers to some genuine errors, there is also concern it is being used by its political opponents. Some BBC figures point to an effort to shift the corporation politically, dating back to Boris Johnson’s time in government. The Guardian has been told Prescott’s appointment as an external adviser had been pushed by the BBC board member Robbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former communications chief who helped set up the rightwing broadcaster GB News. Gibb was first placed on the BBC board during Johnson’s time in government. Gibb and Prescott have previously been reported as being friends. Gibb was on a four-person interview panel that appointed Prescott. Johnson told the Guardian that any suggestion of an attempt to undermine the BBC was “complete and utter bollocks”. Prescott said in his letter that his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/09/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6d4241a3c514a666594fdcb612d7714161b04870/425_308_2528_2022/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"media\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"media\",\"sectionName\":\"Media\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T19:35:00Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Tim Davie resigns as BBC director general after accusations of \\u2018serious and systemic\\u2019 bias in coverage\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/media\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/media\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Tim Davie resigns as BBC director general after accusations of \\u2018serious and systemic\\u2019 bias in coverage\",\"trailText\":\"Davie says departure is \\u2018my own decision\\u2019, while head of news also quits.

After leaving his role as vice-president of marketing and franchise at PepsiCo, Davie became director of the BBC’s marketing, communications and audiences division in 2005. In 2008, he took on the role of director of the audio and music division. This involved running a variety of radio stations, including Radio 1, 2, 3, and 4. It was during this time that Davie led the plans to scrap 6 Music and the Asian Network, saying the corporation had too many stations and needed to invest in “unique, high-quality radio”. The BBC backed down on closing both stations after a huge public campaign. Also in 2008, Davie had to address controversy surrounding a prank call made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to the actor Andrew Sachs on Radio 2. In 2012, Davie took on the role of chief executive of the corporation’s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. In November of that year he became acting director general of the BBC after the resignation of George Entwistle, amid the Jimmy Savile crisis. Davie’s stint, which lasted a matter of months until the arrival of Tony Hall, was brief but eventful. He dealt with the fallout from a Newsnight report that wrongly accused the Tory peer Lord McAlpine of child sexual abuse. Davie’s return came just after the corporation ended its disastrous and highly criticised ownership of the travel publisher Lonely Planet, selling it for an £80m loss, in March 2013. In 2018, Davie oversaw the merger of BBC Worldwide with the corporation’s production arm. This led to the formation of BBC Studios, the corporation’s main commercial subsidiary. He was the BBC’s highest-paid executive, making £642,000 in 2019 – considerably more than Hall’s £475,000. Davie turned down an offer to become head of the Premier League in 2019, before being named the BBC’s new director general in June 2020 and taking on the role in September of that year. Davie said he was “honoured” to be appointed, adding that he had a “deep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality”. Sir David Clementi, the then-chair of the BBC board, hailed Davie as “one of the most respected names in the industry”, adding: “His leadership and experience, both outside the BBC and within, will ensure that we are well placed to meet the opportunities and challenges of the coming years.” Davie had to tighten his belt in taking the top role, agreeing to Hall’s salary until mid-2021, when it rose to £525,000. He was also chair of Comic Relief, a role he relinquished before becoming director general. His time as BBC director general was marked by several high-profile controversies including the brief suspension of Match of the Day host Gary Lineker in 2023. The former England footballer was suspended after posting a tweet comparing the language used to launch a new government asylum seeker policy with 1930s Germany. Davie faced pressure after a host of sports presenters and pundits pulled out of BBC shows over the suspension, but defended the decision. Upon Lineker’s return, Davie announced there would be an independent review into the BBC’s social media guidelines and apologised for a “difficult period for staff, contributors, presenters, and most importantly, our audiences”. In recent months, the BBC has faced numerous controversies including the livestreaming of Bob Vylan’s performance at Glastonbury where the punk rappers led chants of “death, death to the IDF” [Israel Defense Forces], as well as misconduct allegations surrounding the former MasterChef presenter Gregg Wallace. Last month, the communications watchdog Ofcom imposed sanctions on the BBC for breaching the broadcasting code over its Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone documentary after the corporation failed to disclose a narrator’s links to Hamas. Davie joined the BBC from Pepsi, where he was responsible for European marketing, including the decision to colour a Concorde and the Daily Mirror Pepsi blue for a campaign. Davie joined Pepsi in 1993 after cutting his teeth as a marketer at Procter &amp; Gamble, which hired him while he was studying English at Cambridge. Born in 1967, he was privately educated at Whitgift school in South Croydon, which he attended after winning a scholarship. Davie also served as an executive board member of the European Broadcasting Union, the world’s leading alliance of public service media organisations.

Bettors on baseball can gamble on whether individual pitches will be balls or strikes. Prosecutors allege claim that Ortiz was paid $5,000 for throwing an intentional ball during a game on 15 June. His teammate Clase, a three-time All-Star, is alleged to have been given $5,000 for facilitating the rigged pitch, alongside gamblers in the players’ home country of the Dominican Republic. Prosecutors claim the pair did so again in a game on 27 June, receiving $7,000 each. ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported that Ortiz was arrested in Boston on Sunday, while Clase has not yet been taken into custody. “MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process. We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” Major League Baseball said in a statement on Sunday. The pair face up to 65 years in prison if found guilty of the allegations, which include charges of fraud, conspiracy and bribery.

Yet after another masterclass in Brazil he defied the odds in taking third from a 19th-place start in the pit lane. It was an extraordinary drive, even as Lando Norris delivered a perfect weekend with a win at Interlagos and in so doing staked a claim to having one hand on the title. Norris’s victory was without doubt that of a champion in waiting as he managed a tense and high‑pressure victory from pole position to extend his world championship lead over his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, who finished fifth. Norris gave a performance of precision and control exactly when it was required to put real daylight on his two title rivals. Yet Verstappen, as ever, was irrepressible at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, where he drove from 17th to victory last season and is now the scene of two of his best drives. With Verstappen and Red Bull having found the pace that eluded them all weekend after taking a new engine and employing a new setup after a dire qualifying, he scythed through the field with verve and dash that was a joy to watch. Every opening he went for he made, even as he made three pit stops, including an early one for a slow puncture. He had to come back from 19th at the start then 18th after his first stop and yet his rise through the field appeared inexorable. Norris matched him with the controlled drive required to convert his pole and in so doing now has the whip hand. After scoring the maximum possible points with victories in the sprint and the GP, Norris has a 24‑point advantage over Piastri while Verstappen is 49 points behind, with 83 points still to race for in the final three meetings at Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. The turnaround for Norris, with his seventh victory this season, has been extraordinary since he was 34 points behind Piastri after the Dutch GP in August – a period when his credentials as a world champion and whether he had the steel to fight for it were being questioned. They were opinions he felt he had answered emphatically when asked on the reasons for his recent form. “Just ignore everyone who talks crap about you and focus on yourself,” he said. “There’s not a long way to go but it can change so quickly, like we’ve seen today. So, just focus on myself, keep my head down, ignore everyone and keep pushing.” For all that Verstappen played centre stage with a captivating soliloquy, Norris’s performance drives the narrative: a decisive moment in the title race given that Piastri endured another blow to his hopes. Starting from fourth he took an early 10‑second penalty for causing a collision when he locked up and hit Kimi Antonelli at turn one. Although he delivered a strong performance to recover, the damage was done. Piastri might feel aggrieved that he was not at fault as he made a legitimate move up the inside and that Antonelli had not given him enough space, but he has been on the back foot all weekend. He crashed out in the sprint race while Norris completed the full monty of pole and victory in both disciplines. After taking pole on Saturday Norris had acknowledged that he had addressed weaknesses in his performances this season and noticeably was now expressing a quiet confidence in how he was driving. Norris can, as he has admitted, be a glass half-empty character, unafraid of self-criticism – so that he now feels he really is on top of his game is telling and was manifest from his control in a tough test in Brazil. Norris not only enjoys the lead but, it appears, the same calm assurance Piastri held when he dominated in the early part of the season. As the race ebbed and flowed, a complex challenge marked by varying tyre strategies was made all the more intriguing by Verstappen barrelling about as an excitable stallion as he advanced on the leaders – the McLaren pit wall and Norris having to factor in a Red Bull that had looked all but irrelevant on Saturday afternoon. Having opted to take the penalty and start Verstappen from the pit lane in an effort to address the setup issues which had left him struggling so badly, Red Bull’s boldness paid off. His pace at times was fearsome, up to a second and half up on Norris, who insisted the world champion remained a player in the title race. “With how quick he was today, he probably would have won if he started higher up.” he said, “He will be a threat, he always is, he is always fighting and will fight to the end. When asked if he could have covered Verstappen’s pace in a straight fight, he gave an unequivocal “no”. It is, nonetheless, Norris who holds all the cards, but Verstappen demonstrated in striking fashionhe really is not quite ready to forget the championship yet.

If only it hadn’t been bumped down the schedules because of Strictly', 'As I watch a leopard hunt in Kingdom, the BBC’s latest David Attenborough-narrated documentary, I find myself thinking about a YouGov survey from a few years ago that found that half of Britons wouldn’t take a free trip to the moon, with 11% turning it down because “there isn’t enough to see and do”. As well as it providing a fantastic insight into the great British public’s psyche (would outer space be better if it had Alton Towers?), I can’t help but wonder if it also explains the pressure that TV commissioners feel under to find new ways to interest the pesky human race in sights that would previously have been greeted with wonder. Back in 2017, Blue Planet II was the most-watched programme of the year, with 14.1 million viewers tuning in to see dolphins surf on prime time. Today, the six-part Kingdom has been bumped to the teatime slot, and finding out which Strictly celeb’s rumba has been voted the most mediocre is deemed more important to the schedule. Still, it is not as if Attenborough, and the enormous team behind him, have stopped trying. Billed by the BBC as “one of the most ambitious projects” ever undertaken by its Natural History Unit, Kingdom was filmed over the course of five years and has an impressive scope. But it focuses on the lives of four African animal families – leopards, hyenas, wild dogs and lions – as they jostle for dominance in a fertile river valley in Zambia. It is essentially Game of Thrones if Cersei was a hyena and everyone was competing for some dinner. Watching the opening title sequence, in which images of the various animal dynasties are superimposed over a map of their territory, you half expect Sean Bean’s face to pop up on the northern border. Winter is coming! No, sorry, that’s some leopards. We are introduced to Olimba, undisputed queen of the valley for a decade, who is teaching her son Moyo, and daughter, Mutima, about danger at the local mud bath. As Moyo – courageous but quite daft – wanders through the water oblivious to a hippopotamus camouflaged beneath, Mutima looks on from the sidelines with a stare many sisters will recognise. Disaster is averted this time (we’re only 11 minutes in, after all) but the producers may as well hold up a sign that reads “FORESHADOWING”. Viewers with a sensitive disposition should not get attached to Moyo/Jon Snow. As we watch Olimba hunt to feed her cubs, new arrival Storm – a wild dog and rival queen – enters with her pack stage left to get the prey for herself. Outnumbered, Olimba has no choice but to hide from the dogs in a treetop; a humbling sight for such a majestic creature. If you’re siding with the leopards at this point, nature conveniently provides a plot twist. As Storm enjoys her feast, hyenas – a species typically twice the size of wild dogs – turn up to try to steal her spoils. Suddenly you find yourself swapping allegiances. Team Wild Dog! But also Team Leopard. Saying that, I can only respect pregnant hyena Tandala. While her family are off nabbing prey, she keeps out of the drama, sunbathing by the water with her eyes half shut. Anthropomorphism risks aside, by the time Tandala is hiding her snack in the river to keep it away from her annoying relatives, you can’t help but see your mum storing the Celebrations under the bed because your dad won’t stop eating the Maltesers Teasers. Wildlife shows often spotlight the innate quest for survival, and Kingdom puts it at the forefront. But the shots of supporting characters – from elephants and giraffes to zebras – congregating at the river are some of the most striking, as if we are spying on utopia. The third act brings another pack to threaten the leopard’s reign, and with it, the most emotive scene of the hour. When Moyo goes missing, Olimba searches day and night for her son. By morning, Moyo has been found dead, his wounds likely caused by a lion. We have been privileged to see much of this before. And yet that’s the thing about the Attenborough franchise in 2025. No matter how many times viewers have watched similar chains of events, it is still deeply moving to hear a mother call for her child and know he is not coming back. The episode ends with a cliffhanger, when Storm’s new litter are surrounded by a group of lions. Seven puppies hide in a den but one is left behind. Attenborough teases the next episode: “Can Storm rescue her pup in time or will it have to face the lions alone?” Repetitive? Perhaps. Awe-inspiring, exhilarating and affecting? Certainly. • Kingdom aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now in the UK, and will air on the Nine Network in Australia at a later date', 'https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/nov/09/kingdom-review-david-attenborough-bbc-one-iplayer-natural-history-unit', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a3f17e9165de93906e3d889df058cb56960830bb/386_0_3571_2857/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/kingdom-review-david-attenborough-bbc-one-iplayer-natural-history-unit\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"tv-and-radio\",\"sectionName\":\"Television & radio\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T19:10:39Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Kingdom review \\u2013 David Attenborough never fails to make nature awe-inspiring\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/kingdom-review-david-attenborough-bbc-one-iplayer-natural-history-unit\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/tv-and-radio\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/kingdom-review-david-attenborough-bbc-one-iplayer-natural-history-unit\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Kingdom review \\u2013 David Attenborough never fails to make nature awe-inspiring\",\"trailText\":\"Attenborough\\u2019s latest extravaganza is packed with such high drama it\\u2019s like Game of Thrones \\u2026 if Cersei was a hyena.

Goodnight! Ruben Dias We live for games like this – there’s no higher level. I’m very happy for everyone. I remember before I came to this club, it was the details that made them win so much – everybody ready to sacrifice for the guy next to them. We’ve been talking about a rebuild since last season. There were many changes and there are new faces, but the quality stays the same and we keep on pushing. It’s still early in the season; feet on the ground. Jeremy Doku [Have you ever played better?] I dunno. In big games it’s always more beautiful. I’m just happy with the way we played. I’ve got great players around me who push me every day. He [points at Dias] pushes me every day because he believes in me. City move to within four points of Arsenal after a surprisingly easy victory over Liverpool. Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez and the magnificent Jeremy Doku scored the goals, while Haaland also had a penalty saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili at 0-0. Liverpool were sluggish and subdued, though they might have equalised at 1-1 when Virgil van Dijk’s header was disallowed for offside against Andy Robertson. City were much the better team overall. 90+1 min Szoboszlai leaves a bit on Foden - “gives him one” says Gary Neville – and is booked. 90 min There will be three minutes of added nothingness. 89 min Jones fouls Savinho and is booked. 89 min The title race is still on. The race for the golden boot, not so much. 87 min O’Reilly shoots wide of the near post from a tight angle. 85 min “Liverpool absolutely winning the transfer window looks now like a midlife crisis spending spree,” writes Niall Mullen. “The sports car turned out to be an old banger, the leather jacket disintegrated in the rain and the new young partner is nowhere to be found having nicked your watch and seemingly mistaken your trainers for a toilet.” 83 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Federico Chiesa and Joe Gomez replace Florian Wirtz and Conor Bradley, who in different ways had very tough afternoons. Wirtz struggled to get in the game; Bradley struggled to keep Jeremy Doku out of it. 82 min: Great chance for City! Foden waves a gorgeous square pass to find O’Reilly in space on the edge of the area. He takes a touch and blooters over the bar. 79 min: Big chance for Salah! For the first time Salah gets the wrong side of O’Reilly and runs through on goal. He flicks the bouncing ball around Donnarumma and just wide of the far post. 78 min A Liverpool corner is half cleared and then headed back into the area by Bradley. Van Dijk is first to the ball but overruns it and Donnarumma dives at his feet. Liverpool have had a flurry of corners in the last few minutes – but only one shot on target all game, that sizzler from Szoboszlai a moment ago. 76 min Szoboszlai roasts a rising drive from 25 yards that is pawed round the post by the diving Donnarumma. It was fairly central but beautifully hit. 74 min: Liverpool substitution Curtis Jones on for Alexis Mac Allister. Marmoush, just on for City, has a shot blocked by Bradley in the D. 74 min: City substitution Omar Marmoush replaces Jeremy Doku, who receives a standing ovation from the home fans. There will be few more exhilarating individual performances all season. 73 min “Always a classic…” is the subject of Matt Dony’s email, which reads thus: “Can Arne Slot bring on Dietmar Hamann?” 72 min Szoboszlai does beat O’Reilly and slides an inviting cross that is turned behind for a corner by Nunes. 72 min Salah’s cross/pass is cut out by O’Reilly, who has had the better of that battle so far. 68 min Liverpool are facing a fourth successive league defeat away from home; the last time that happened was in 2011-12. 67 min That goal was perfectly timed for City, who were under a bit of pressure for the first time in the match. Doku has been unplayable all day. 65 min City will move up to second with this result, four points behind Arsenal. Liverpool are currently eighth, below Manchester United on goals scored. Doku has been the player of the match by a country mile. Nico Gonzalez started the move with a crossfield pass to O’Reilly, who knocked the ball back to Doku in the inside-left channel. He fronted up Konate on the edge of the area, shuffled to the right and whacked an unstoppable curler into the far corner. Glorious goal. Jeremy Doku caps a sensational performance with a quite brilliant goal! 62 min Liverpool have been better in the second half, if still well short of the best, and City aren’t keeping the ball any more. A goal would make things really interesting. 59 min: Big chance for Gakpo! Salah plays in the underlapping Bradley, who fires a beautiful first-time ball across the six-yard box. It bounces up to Gakpo at the far post, but he can’t sort his feet out and sends the ball into orbit. That’s Liverpool’s best chance. 58 min Florian Wirtz is now playing up front for Liverpool with Gakpo on the left. Alexander Isak is on the bench, though he only returned to training on Friday. 57 min Nico Gonzalez almost does a Tommy Hutchison by scoring at. both ends. Bradley hammered a cross that Gonzalez, trying to clear, shanked onto the roof of his own net. 56 min: Double substituton for Liverpool Milos Kerkez and Cody Gakpo replace Andy Robertson and Hugo Ekitike. I forgot to say that it’s pelting down at the Etihad. 55 min Doku zig-zags beautifully between Bradley and Gravenberch before lifting a shot that is comfortably saved by Mamardashvili. He’s been sensational. 54 min “As an Arsenal fan, I was looking for the draw, but not too bad with City winning,” writes David Penney. “I feel as soon as Haaland is injured this season, City will drop a lot of points.” 53 min: Man City substitution Savinho replaces Rayan Cherki, who has had a relatively quiet game. 51 min The magnificent Doku covers 70 yards on the break and finds Cherki, whose shot from 15 yards is blocked. Bradley is booked for a foul on somebody in the build-up, either Doku or Nico Gonzalez. 50 min Donnarumma comes charging out of his area for no particular reason and is very lucky that Ruben Dias slides in to knock the ball away from both him and Mo Salah. No need for Donnarumma to come out then. 49 min “To précis a great quote from a great man,” begins Niall Mullen, and I think we all know where this is heading, “‘There’s no shame in losing, but plenty in losing shite.’ Slot is meticulous but it seems he hasn’t read the complete works of Peter Reid.”” 47 min At the other end, the impressive O’Reilly fizzes a low cross that only just evades Doku in front of goal 47 min “Just caught up with the preamble and the simpering reference to a ‘vaguely competent’ Haaland and felt compelled to add my ten pence worth about how over hyped he is,” writes Brian Withington. “Take away the goals, defensive headers and the marauding terror he induces in the opposition and what are we really left with?” 46 min A bit of early pressure from Liverpool, with Bradley and then Salah having shots blocked. 46 min City begin the second half – no substitutions on either side. Pep Guardiola’s 1000th game as a manager is going swimmingly. Manchester City have been good rather than spectacular - but they lead Liverpool 2-0 and Erling Haaland has had a penalty saved. Haaland made amends by putting City in front, Virgil van Dijk had an equaliser disallowed for a pedantic offside and then deflected Nico Gonzalez’s long-range shot past Giorgi Mamaradashvili. 45+6 min Gary Neville is putting the boot in on Liverpool – he says they look “leggy”, have “lost every single battle” and put in a “worrying performance”. 45+5 min “Ok, I accept that Mike Dean knows more than me,” begins Matt Dony, “but reading Law 11: Offside on the FA website, I can’t see how Robertson was offside. He made no attempt to play the ball, no movement towards the ball, didn’t interfere with any City players’ ability to play the ball or challenge any of them, and wasn’t in Donnarumma’s line of sight. I don’t know what’s going on any more.” One City corner led to another, this time on the left. It was taken short and worked infield to Nico Gonzalez, whose low drive from 25 yards hit Van Dijk – who waved a lazy right leg – and wrongfooted Mamardashvili. A hammer blow to Liverpool on the stroke of half-time. 45+2 min Bernardo Silva finds Cherki, who clips a cross that is headed behind by Van Dijk. It’s been a strange half, lacking the intensity we usually see in this fixture. 45 min The VAR checks and a couple of bits of treatment mean there will be seven minutes of added time. 45 min “In two minds about that disallowed goal,” writes Joshua Keeling. “Under the letter of the law it’s technically correct - he was in an offside position and he ducked under the ball. But at the same time, Donnarumma wasn’t getting to that header. So I’m on the fence.” Yeah, it’s a tough one because there was no material impact on the goal. 42 min Wirtz has a shot blocked at source after a smart turn just inside the City area. This is Liverpool’s best spell. 41 min Bernardo Silva is booked for tripping someone. 39 min Van Dijk beat Donnarumma with a majestic header from a corner. Robertson – in an offside position three yards from goal – ducked to allow the ball to go over him and into the net. He wasn’t in Donnarumma’s eyeline, nor did he impede his dive - but Mike Dean, on Sky, says it was the correct decision in accordance with the current interpretation of the law. Arne Slot does not concur. Virgil van Dijk thinks he’s equalised for Liverpool – but there’s a VAR check… 36 min Mac Allister trips Doku and is booked. 35 min Given City’s occasional susceptibility to counter-attacks, the decision to pick Wirtz ahead of Cody Gakpo probably wasn’t the best. Then again, I can’t imagine Arne Slot expected his team to have so little of the ball in the first 35 minutes. 32 min Liverpool, strangely passive in possession at 0-0, will have to come out and play now. 30 min That goal ultimately stemmed from some excellent one-touch passing/escapology from City when they were surrounded by Liverpool players in their own half. Erling Haaland heads City in front. It was a slightly odd goal: the right-back Nunes curled a standard cross to the far post, where Konate and Haaland challenged for the header. The ball brushed Konate’s head, hit Haaland a millisecond later and looped slowly into the net. No idea how much Haaland knew about it. He won’t care, nor should he. If at first you don’t succeed… 27 min Nico Gonzalez is booked for a cynical foul on Wirtz, who slipped a couple of City players neatly and would have led a Liverpool break. 26 min Doku barrrels past Bradley in the area, then twists back outside Gravenberch and whacks a shot from a tight angle that is touched round the near post by Mamardashvili. It was probably going wide but Mamardashvili couldn’t take a chance and his reactions were excelllent. 25 min I thought, after Brian Brobbery’s equaliser for Sunderland against Arsenal, that both teams would come flying out of the traps. It’s been the opposite; Doku aside, the attacking players have done the square root of bugger all. 23 min O’Reilly is going to continue for now. Gary Neville, king of the calf strain in his playing days, thinks O’Reilly’s game could be over. 22 min Maybe not: O’Reilly is down and needs treatment. Looks like a calf problem; he jarred it slightly when shaping to block a possible Salah shot. 21 min A better spell for Liverpool, with Salah getting on the ball in the final third. O’Reilly v Salah should be a fascinating contest today. 20 min “Haaland penalty?” sniffs Peter Oh. “Mama(rdashvili) said knock you out!” 19 min “You’re correct that this a big game,” says Paul Griffin. “Yuge. But does that mean that penalty incident is the biggest thing that’s ever happened? Or is it bigger than that?” Bigger. This liveblog should be written by Walter Cronkite. 18 min Doku surges down the left and slides a square pass intended for Foden on the edge of the area. Instead it nicks off a defender and reaches Cherki, whose shot deflects off Konate and over the bar. Doku has been electric. 16 min The penalty drama aside, it’s been a surprisingly bloodless start to the game. City are keeping the ball a lot better. 15 min On reflection, that wasn’t a particular bad penalty from Haaland – it was a fantastic save from Mamardashvili because the ball would have ended up in the bottom corner. 14 min There was another VAR check to see whether Mamaradashvili was off his line before the kick was taken. But he timed it perfectly and made a superb save. 13 min Not the greatest penalty – swept low to the right but not hit with ferocious power. Even so, what a moment for Mamaradashvili, who got down excellently to push it away. 12 min There was a mistake from Konate earlier in the move – he got in Bradley’s way and kicked the ball against Doku, who was first onto the ricochet and then went past Mamardashvili. Liverpool aren’t happy. Their argument, I suspect, is that Doku initiated the contact. I’m not sure he did. 11 min Mamardashvili’s knee caught Doku’s left foot and tripped him. It wasn’t deliberate but it was a foul. 9 min: Big penalty appeal for City! Doku gets away from Bradley and Konate, goes past the outrushing Mamaradashvili and then falls over. Was he tripped? There was an almighty scramble after that, with a couple of shots blocked. I think this will be a penalty to City. 8 min At the other end Salah, full of intent, knocks a bouncing ball into the City area, forcing the last man Dias to step across and clear. 7 min Doku leads a City break and plays a brilliant angled pass to Foden… who miscontrols it. Crikey. With a good first touch he would have had a clear shooting chance on his right foot. 6 min “I’m not sure how other Liverpool fans might feel about Wirtz being in the team,” wonders Peadar de Burca. “He’s obviously great, and he needs games to get his Premier League groove on, but why do I keep thinking of Juan ‘too good for the Premiership’ Veron...? Still, it would be great fun to hear Slot say, “He’s a f***ing great player and you’re all f***ing idiots.” It’d be even better if he went full Fergie and said ‘Youse’. 5 min Doku, who has made a lively start, nicks a loose ball on the edge of the area and forces his way between two Liverpool defenders. A third red shirt, Konate, steps across to clear. 5 min Gravenberch is penalised twice in the space of a minute for tackles on O’Reilly and Doku. Nothing naughty or yellow card-worthy, but I need to write something here. 4 min “Afternoon Rob,” begins Simon McMahon. “When you said ‘technical problems galore’, I thought you were offering a concise three-word history of Scottish football.” That’d need to be a four-word history surely? 3 min A slow start, with City passing the ball around meticulously in the middle third and Liverpool trying to set traps. 1 min Peep peep. Liverpool kick off from right to left as we watch; this, as you probably know by now, is Pep Guardiola’s 1,000th game as manager. The teams, then. Manchester City, who made a few changes v Dortmund in midweek, go back to the XI that beat Bournemouth a week ago. Liverpool are unsurprisingly unchanged from the win over Real Madrid. Here’s what happened in the 2pm games. Apologies folks, we’ve had technical problems galore. When I say ‘we’… All sorted now, and this very big game is about to kick off. Manchester City (4-3-3ish) Donnarumma; Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly; Bernardo, Nico, Foden; Cherki, Haaland, Doku. Subs: Trafford, Reijnders, Stones, Ake, Marmoush, Ait-Nouri, Savinho, Bobb, Lewis. Liverpool (4-3-3ish) Mamardashvili; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Ekitike, Wirtz. Subs: Woodman, Gomez, Endo, Kerkez, Isak, Chiesa, Jones, Gakpo, Ngumoha. Referee Chris Kavanagh. Hope comes in many forms. Faith. An unlikely human connection. A crescendo of such defiant beauty that you briefly forget the utter state of everything. And a 2-2 draw at the Stadium of Light. Brian Brobbey’s late equaliser for Sunderland against Arsenal last night was exceedingly good news for Manchester City and Liverpool, who should be full of the joys going into this afternoon’s game at the Etihad Stadium. They have the chance to close the gap on Arsenal to four and five points respectively. That’s the good news; the bad news is that only one of them – tops – can do it. City and Liverpool seem to be hitting their stride after dodgy spells earlier in the season. City have won 10 of the last 13 in all competitions; Liverpool ended their slump with defiant victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid. They kept clean sheets in both games, too. That won’t be so easy against Erling Haaland, the red wine of any contemporary clean sheet metaphor. Haaland is in rampant form, with 10 goals in his last six games at the Etihad, and has gone to another level this season. He was vaguely competent beforehand.

We\\u2019ve been talking about a rebuild since last season. There were many changes and there are new faces, but the quality stays the same and we keep on pushing.

I\\u2019m just happy with the way we played. I\\u2019ve got great players around me who push me every day. He [points at Dias] pushes me every day because he believes in me. City move to within four points of Arsenal after a surprisingly easy victory over Liverpool. Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez and the magnificent Jeremy Doku scored the goals, while Haaland also had a penalty saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili at 0-0. Liverpool were sluggish and subdued, though they might have equalised at 1-1 when Virgil van Dijk\\u2019s header was disallowed for offside against Andy Robertson. City were much the better team overall. 90+1 min Szoboszlai leaves a bit on Foden - \\u201cgives him one\\u201d says Gary Neville \\u2013 and is booked. 90 min There will be three minutes of added nothingness. 89 min Jones fouls Savinho and is booked. 89 min The title race is still on.

Wirtz struggled to get in the game; Bradley struggled to keep Jeremy Doku out of it. 82 min: Great chance for City! Foden waves a gorgeous square pass to find O\\u2019Reilly in space on the edge of the area. He takes a touch and blooters over the bar. 79 min: Big chance for Salah! For the first time Salah gets the wrong side of O\\u2019Reilly and runs through on goal. He flicks the bouncing ball around Donnarumma and just wide of the far post. 78 min A Liverpool corner is half cleared and then headed back into the area by Bradley. Van Dijk is first to the ball but overruns it and Donnarumma dives at his feet. Liverpool have had a flurry of corners in the last few minutes \\u2013 but only one shot on target all game, that sizzler from Szoboszlai a moment ago. 76 min Szoboszlai roasts a rising drive from 25 yards that is pawed round the post by the diving Donnarumma. It was fairly central but beautifully hit. 74 min: Liverpool substitution Curtis Jones on for Alexis Mac Allister.

I think this will be a penalty to City. 8 min At the other end Salah, full of intent, knocks a bouncing ball into the City area, forcing the last man Dias to step across and clear. 7 min Doku leads a City break and plays a brilliant angled pass to Foden\\u2026 who miscontrols it. Crikey. With a good first touch he would have had a clear shooting chance on his right foot. 6 min \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure how other Liverpool fans might feel about Wirtz being in the team,\\u201d wonders Peadar de Burca. \\u201cHe\\u2019s obviously great, and he needs games to get his Premier League groove on, but why do I keep thinking of Juan \\u2018too good for the Premiership\\u2019 Veron...? Still, it would be great fun to hear Slot say, \\u201cHe\\u2019s a f***ing great player and you\\u2019re all f***ing idiots.\\u201d It\\u2019d be even better if he went full Fergie and said \\u2018Youse\\u2019. 5 min Doku, who has made a lively start, nicks a loose ball on the edge of the area and forces his way between two Liverpool defenders. A third red shirt, Konate, steps across to clear. 5 min Gravenberch is penalised twice in the space of a minute for tackles on O\\u2019Reilly and Doku. Nothing naughty or yellow card-worthy, but I need to write something here. 4 min \\u201cAfternoon Rob,\\u201d begins Simon McMahon. \\u201cWhen you said \\u2018technical problems galore\\u2019, I thought you were offering a concise three-word history of Scottish football.\\u201d That\\u2019d need to be a four-word history surely? 3 min A slow start, with City passing the ball around meticulously in the middle third and Liverpool trying to set traps. 1 min Peep peep. Liverpool kick off from right to left as we watch; this, as you probably know by now, is Pep Guardiola\\u2019s 1,000th game as manager. The teams, then. Manchester City, who made a few changes v Dortmund in midweek, go back to the XI that beat Bournemouth a week ago. Liverpool are unsurprisingly unchanged from the win over Real Madrid. Here\\u2019s what happened in the 2pm games. Apologies folks, we\\u2019ve had technical problems galore. When I say \\u2018we\\u2019\\u2026 All sorted now, and this very big game is about to kick off. Manchester City (4-3-3ish) Donnarumma; Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O\\u2019Reilly; Bernardo, Nico, Foden; Cherki, Haaland, Doku. Subs: Trafford, Reijnders, Stones, Ake, Marmoush, Ait-Nouri, Savinho, Bobb, Lewis. Liverpool (4-3-3ish) Mamardashvili; Bradley, Konate, Van Dijk, Robertson; Szoboszlai, Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Ekitike, Wirtz. Subs: Woodman, Gomez, Endo, Kerkez, Isak, Chiesa, Jones, Gakpo, Ngumoha. Referee Chris Kavanagh. Hope comes in many forms. Faith. An unlikely human connection. A crescendo of such defiant beauty that you briefly forget the utter state of everything. And a 2-2 draw at the Stadium of Light. Brian Brobbey\\u2019s late equaliser for Sunderland against Arsenal last night was exceedingly good news for Manchester City and Liverpool, who should be full of the joys going into this afternoon\\u2019s game at the Etihad Stadium. They have the chance to close the gap on Arsenal to four and five points respectively. That\\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that only one of them \\u2013 tops \\u2013 can do it. City and Liverpool seem to be hitting their stride after dodgy spells earlier in the season. City have won 10 of the last 13 in all competitions; Liverpool ended their slump with defiant victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid. They kept clean sheets in both games, too. That won\\u2019t be so easy against Erling Haaland, the red wine of any contemporary clean sheet metaphor. Haaland is in rampant form, with 10 goals in his last six games at the Etihad, and has gone to another level this season. He was vaguely competent beforehand. Kick off 4.30pm.\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/sport\",\"pillarName\":\"Sport\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL),

It was Manchester City who cleared their throats and made it plain that they are in this race for the long haul. Liverpool barely got a word in. The table looks a lot more appealing for Pep Guardiola and his players now, City only four points behind Arsenal, and it was an occasion when they blew Liverpool away. They could shrug off the inconvenience of Erling Haaland missing a controversially awarded 13th-minute penalty to put on a show of strength, particularly in the first half. It was Haaland, inevitably, who opened the scoring with his 19th City goal of the season and, after Nico González had benefited from a deflection off Virgil van Dijk in first-half stoppage time, the scene was set for the coup de grace. Jérémy Doku was almost unplayable, a blur of tricks and direct running and his goal for 3-0 was a beauty, a quick move inside before the perfectly executed curler with his right foot into the far corner. He merited the ovation he got when he was substituted towards the end. Liverpool cried foul over two decisions – both driven by the video assistant referee, Michael Oliver. They got away with the penalty when Giorgi Mamardashvili kept out Haaland’s kick but the sickener was when Van Dijk had a header for 1-1 ruled out after a corner. Andy Robertson was in an offside position close to Gianluigi Donnarumma and it mattered not that the City goalkeeper looked unlikely to make the save. It was a real letter of the law call. It was not the reason why Liverpool lost. City were slicker and more incisive; they carried the greater physical threat, too. It was difficult not to fear that Liverpool’s title defence has ended here and not only because they trail Arsenal by eight points. It was the manner in which they fell to a fourth away league defeat in succession for the first time since 2012. There had been no little fanfare after their midweek Champions League win over Real Madrid. They were back. Not on this evidence. Guardiola was lauded for his 1,000th game as a manager beforehand, City screening an extended and effusive tribute to him on the big screen, and it was then on to trying to unpick another of his tactical setups. Because the fluency, the positional interchanges of his midfielders, was really something. City brought intensity from the first whistle, Doku marauding from the left, popping up all over. Bernardo Silva sat alongside González one minute and pushed high or wide the next. He would control the tempo. Guardiola consistently seemed to have the extra man in midfield. Nico O’Reilly caused problems from left-back when he was not doing a defensive number on Mohamed Salah. The touchpaper was lit by the penalty decision, the referee, Chris Kavanagh, advised by Oliver to study the replays of the moment when Doku appeared to bulldoze through Ibrahima Konaté before slicing back from the byline and seeing Mamardashvili come flying out at him. The contact was minimal – one of those where you had to look very hard from a specific angle to discover it – and, if it was technically there, it did not disguise the reality that the award was soft. City did not relent after Mamardashvili’s save. Doku shimmered with menace. It was the skills, the pace, the strength; the complete package. Rayan Cherki had a shot blocked by Konaté and the breakthrough had been advertised. Liverpool were in danger of being run off the pitch. It was remarkable to see how many one-on-one duels they lost before the interval; how they plodded without inspiration. Haaland’s goal for 1-0 was strange, albeit the buildup was lovely. Konaté appeared to get a little flick to Matheus Nunes’s cross from the right with Haaland airborne behind him. But the striker still managed to loop the header back into the corner of the net. How much did he know about it? Then again, it was Haaland. Slot raged on the touchline when the Van Dijk lifeline was snuffed out – the Liverpool captain bullied Nunes to thump home his header – and the wound was salted when González tried his luck from distance. The ball just had to take a decisive flick off Van Dijk. Slot had stuck with his back-to-basics approach, the same lineup – broadly – that he played in the victories against Aston Villa and Real that had given Liverpool optimism in the buildup. The key detail was that it was the midfield three from the title-winning season last time out, with Florian Wirtz on the left of the front three. Wirtz had a few flickers, City having to resort to some roughhouse stuff to stop him. Liverpool pushed after the restart. They were better, even if the bar was low. Ryan Gravenberch almost released Salah, Rúben Dias forced into a saving challenge as Donnarumma made a reckless bolt from his area. González nearly put through his own goal while Cody Gakpo, on as a substitute for the anonymous Hugo Ekitiké, blazed over when well placed. Doku kept coming. He enjoyed himself, the alarm bells ringing for Liverpool whenever he got on the ball. His goal was the showstopper. Dominik Szoboszlai would work Donnarumma with a piledriver while Salah touched narrowly wide of the far corner in a one-on-one.

(193, 73, 16, 'thefilter-us/2025/nov/09/winter-clothing-essentials-cold-weather-protection-scandinavian', 'Eight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by – from heated socks to ‘allværsjakke’', 'Brace for the cold with these clever accessories made and tested by people who know long, dark winters', 'Scandinavians know how to dress for forbidding weather. The long Scandinavian winter, which typically stretches from November until late March, demands layers of clothing and plenty of protection against the cold. While temperatures can plummet to -30C (-22F) farther north in Sweden and Norway, winters farther south in Sweden, Norway and Denmark tend to be milder and wetter, requiring breathable materials that also withstand rain. Moving abroad to the UK and then returning to Sweden, I realized how underdressed people were outside Scandinavia. It became even more obvious after having kids and noticing how we always try to dress them appropriately, including several layers of clothing that are finished off with a pair of thick shell pants. To help non-Scandinavians and Scandinavians alike dress fearlessly for the chilly months ahead, I’ve gathered eight favourite products you’ll spot on the streets and slopes across the Nordic region right now. I’ve honed these insights writing about lifestyle topics, including fashion, for 15 years. Plus, I founded my own accessories brand. For this piece I also sought the advice of nine people in both Scandinavia and Finland. Winter boots Unisex $212.95 at BobLeisure In Stockholm, sturdy winter boots are an essential, and fashion often takes a back seat to dry feet. Polyver boots, made in Jämtland in northern Sweden, are waterproof and feature a special “Cli-Tech” material. The company says these are made up of millions of encapsulated air bubbles that make them ideal for cold conditions. Originally a favourite among nature enthusiasts, they’ve become a go-to for city dwellers in recent years. In Stockholm, winters can range from 10C (50F) to -15C (5F), with anything from slush and bare streets to a full metre of snow. “I can’t have a separate pair of shoes for every type of weather – ideally, I want one pair that works across the board,” says Kajsa Lindholm, a teacher based in Stockholm. “Polyver boots have that dressing-gown or pyjamas feel – you just slip them on and head out.” Another option is the Canadian Sorel boot, which is waterproof and, as I’ve spotted, is frequently worn by Finns. Men’s $225 at Sorel $225 at Nordstrom Women’s $224.95 at Amazon $225 at Sorel Wool base layer Men’s $105 at Icebreaker $105 at REI Women’s $73.50 at Icebreaker Step inside a preschool in Scandinavia and you will find children and adults alike wearing at least three layers of clothing. In Finland, the wool base layer is a winter essential, especially in cold and wet conditions, since wool retains heat even when damp. For Werneri Varhanen, founder of a clothing brand in Helsinki, that typically means wool as a base, then fleece, followed by a winter jacket or light puffer, topped with a waterproof and windproof shell. “That way, you can adjust to a variety of temperatures and conditions just by adding or removing a layer,” he says. “For wool base layers, a personal favourite – and quite popular here – is the New Zealand brand Icebreaker. But I also like Norway’s Devold.” Half-finger gloves Unisex $45 at Hestra $44.95 at Amazon The half-finger glove, also called the “market glove”, was originally designed to make it easier to handle goods and money at outdoor markets in cold conditions, when fingers needed to stay free. Denmark’s mild winters, combined with Copenhagen’s bike-friendly streets, have made them popular for a different reason – allowing an active lifestyle while staying warm (and stylish). Danes ride year-round – and their wardrobes reflect it. Clothes need to be practical and functional, yet never at the expense of looking good. “The bike culture is huge here and in the last few years the winters haven’t been as cold as they usually are,” says Teodora Kolchagova, a brand and communications manager in Copenhagen. “I love the half-finger gloves – Hestra does really nice ones in wool.” Long puffer jacket The long puffer jacket has faced some undeserved ridicule in Sweden in recent years for its bulky shape and supposed lack of style. Often nicknamed the “mother sausage”, it’s commonly spotted on mothers with young babies out on stroller walks. While Swedish fashion journalist Samanda Ekman argues that the coat represents “anti-fashion”, author Johanna Schreiber sees it as a symbol of “women’s liberation”. The coat’s popularity is easy to understand: filled with down, it’s loved for its cocoon-like warmth. “It’s like wearing a duvet,” says Nina Lindesvärd, an engineer in Stockholm, who wears a black long puffer from Samsøe Samsøe. “It’s also great for wearing with a skirt underneath – or the opposite: sweatpants for a grocery run, and no one will notice. In general, I don’t like coats that don’t cover my behind.” While Lindesvärd’s jacket is only available for women, Rains does an excellent version for both women and men (my husband has one). Men’s $550 at Rains Women’s $550 at Rains Heated socks Unisex Non-compression version on Amazon, batteries included: $444.95 at Amazon Compression version on Amazon, batteries included: $479.94 at Amazon The most traditional Scandinavian sock is the hand-knitted wool sock, worn either on its own or layered over another sock inside shoes. Many families have someone who makes them, but if bought, they usually come from flea markets or directly from local makers. For Juho Pihlajaoja, a freelance stylist in Helsinki, it is a colourful version in blue, green and orange. “I’m sitting on a lounge chair post-sauna wearing a pair right now,” he says. As clothing has become more technical, however, many Scandinavians swear by knee-high socks heated with rechargeable batteries. “They are incredible,” says Sophie Snell, a photographer based in the Swedish ski destination Åre, of her socks from Lenz. “It’s something I truly can’t live without – or work without, for that matter.” Lenz socks can be pricey, though Snell says: “I’ve had the same pair of socks for almost seven years now and they still haven’t broken.” These cheaper alternatives have decent reviews on Amazon – though here at the Filter we don’t have personal experience of them. Amazon rechargeable electric heated socks $79.99 at Amazon Pedestrian safety reflector $14.99 at Amazon They may be tiny, but they make a huge impact during the dark Scandinavian winters. The pedestrian safety reflector, originally invented by Arvi Lehti in Pertteli, Finland, in 1963, is incredibly common. You’ll see them clipped to jackets and bags everywhere, especially since it gets dark so early in winter. According to the Finnish Road Safety Council, a person is normally visible in car headlights at 50 metres (165ft), but with a reflector, visibility increases to 350 metres (1,150ft). “It’s a typical Finnish thing – a little plastic piece you attach to your sleeve, in its most classic form, so you can be seen in the dark,” says Elna Nykänen Andersson, a Finnish native now working as a diplomatic counsellor based in Tokyo. “There are loads of different designs, but I wear the classic snowflake.” I haven’t been able to find this exact snowflake design on sale in the US, but based on my research this is a close contender. Allværsjakke – the ‘all-weather jacket’ Women’s $530 at Fjällräven $530 at REI Men’s $800 at Houdini Sportswear Norway is known for its strong hiking culture, which has also shaped its outdoor fashion. The top priority for Norwegians is to dress according to the weather – and there’s even a local word for the jacket: allværsjakke, meaning “all-weather jacket”. Originally a simple raincoat or anorak, it has evolved into a more technical garment, such as a parka, perfect for unpredictable weather. “I love that it’s waterproof and lined, so it’s warm and can handle all kinds of weather,” says Oslo-based journalist Vibeke Stiansen, who recommends these parkas from Fjällräven (for women) and Houdini (for men). And like many Scandinavians, she layers underneath it. “I would typically wear a basic T-shirt or shirt with jeans or tailored trousers, and then a lovely knitted jumper on top – either a short one in cashmere or merino wool, or a long, oversized style, preferably in wool or a mohair blend,” she says. Balaclava Women’s $155 at Malina Men’s $139 at Cos This hat, which covers large parts of the head and face, has become a fashion statement. “I love my balaclavas,” says Stockholm-based Sara Brandt Zaric, a communications professional, who owns three versions – and recommends this one from Malina (for women) and Cos (for men). Cos also does a lovely version for women, but it’s currently out of stock in the US. “I think there’s something beautiful about how a balaclava frames the face,” says Brandt Zaric.” Above all, it’s incredibly practical – especially if it extends a bit down over the chest and back, and is easy to pull down. It keeps you warm without any gaps, protecting against both snow and wind. And you don’t lose it if you pull it back off your head. I hate being cold, yet I still want to dress for work and city life, even when it’s freezing.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter-us/2025/nov/09/winter-clothing-essentials-cold-weather-protection-scandinavian', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6c0070725b00fa756ee428c48dfcf8b211451f1d/0_0_1799_1440/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"thefilter-us\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/winter-clothing-essentials-cold-weather-protection-scandinavian\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"thefilter-us\",\"sectionName\":\"The Filter US\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T18:15:38Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Eight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by \\u2013 from heated socks to \\u2018allv\\u00e6rsjakke\\u2019\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/thefilter-us\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/winter-clothing-essentials-cold-weather-protection-scandinavian\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/thefilter-us\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/winter-clothing-essentials-cold-weather-protection-scandinavian\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Eight winter clothing essentials Scandinavians swear by \\u2013 from heated socks to \\u2018allv\\u00e6rsjakke\\u2019\",\"trailText\":\"Brace for the cold with these clever accessories made and tested by people who know long, dark winters\",\"byline\":\"Jonna Dagliden Hunt\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/6c0070725b00fa756ee428c48dfcf8b211451f1d\\/0_0_1799_1440\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Scandinavians know how to dress for forbidding weather. The long Scandinavian winter, which typically stretches from November until late March, demands layers of clothing and plenty of protection against the cold. While temperatures can plummet to -30C (-22F) farther north in Sweden and Norway, winters farther south in Sweden, Norway and Denmark tend to be milder and wetter, requiring breathable materials that also withstand rain. Moving abroad to the UK and then returning to Sweden, I realized how underdressed people were outside Scandinavia. It became even more obvious after having kids and noticing how we always try to dress them appropriately, including several layers of clothing that are finished off with a pair of thick shell pants. To help non-Scandinavians and Scandinavians alike dress fearlessly for the chilly months ahead, I\\u2019ve gathered eight favourite products you\\u2019ll spot on the streets and slopes across the Nordic region right now. I\\u2019ve honed these insights writing about lifestyle topics, including fashion, for 15 years. Plus, I founded my own accessories brand. For this piece I also sought the advice of nine people in both Scandinavia and Finland. Winter boots Unisex $212.95 at BobLeisure In Stockholm, sturdy winter boots are an essential, and fashion often takes a back seat to dry feet. Polyver boots, made in J\\u00e4mtland in northern Sweden, are waterproof and feature a special \\u201cCli-Tech\\u201d material. The company says these are made up of millions of encapsulated air bubbles that make them ideal for cold conditions. Originally a favourite among nature enthusiasts, they\\u2019ve become a go-to for city dwellers in recent years. In Stockholm, winters can range from 10C (50F) to -15C (5F), with anything from slush and bare streets to a full metre of snow. \\u201cI can\\u2019t have a separate pair of shoes for every type of weather \\u2013 ideally, I want one pair that works across the board,\\u201d says Kajsa Lindholm, a teacher based in Stockholm. \\u201cPolyver boots have that dressing-gown or pyjamas feel \\u2013 you just slip them on and head out.\\u201d Another option is the Canadian Sorel boot, which is waterproof and, as I\\u2019ve spotted, is frequently worn by Finns. Men\\u2019s $225 at Sorel $225 at Nordstrom Women\\u2019s $224.95 at Amazon $225 at Sorel Wool base layer Men\\u2019s $105 at Icebreaker $105 at REI Women\\u2019s $73.50 at Icebreaker Step inside a preschool in Scandinavia and you will find children and adults alike wearing at least three layers of clothing. In Finland, the wool base layer is a winter essential, especially in cold and wet conditions, since wool retains heat even when damp. For Werneri Varhanen, founder of a clothing brand in Helsinki, that typically means wool as a base, then fleece, followed by a winter jacket or light puffer, topped with a waterproof and windproof shell. \\u201cThat way, you can adjust to a variety of temperatures and conditions just by adding or removing a layer,\\u201d he says. \\u201cFor wool base layers, a personal favourite \\u2013 and quite popular here \\u2013 is the New Zealand brand Icebreaker. But I also like Norway\\u2019s Devold.\\u201d Half-finger gloves Unisex $45 at Hestra $44.95 at Amazon The half-finger glove, also called the \\u201cmarket glove\\u201d, was originally designed to make it easier to handle goods and money at outdoor markets in cold conditions, when fingers needed to stay free. Denmark\\u2019s mild winters, combined with Copenhagen\\u2019s bike-friendly streets, have made them popular for a different reason \\u2013 allowing an active lifestyle while staying warm (and stylish). Danes ride year-round \\u2013 and their wardrobes reflect it. Clothes need to be practical and functional, yet never at the expense of looking good. \\u201cThe bike culture is huge here and in the last few years the winters haven\\u2019t been as cold as they usually are,\\u201d says Teodora Kolchagova, a brand and communications manager in Copenhagen. \\u201cI love the half-finger gloves \\u2013 Hestra does really nice ones in wool.\\u201d Long puffer jacket The long puffer jacket has faced some undeserved ridicule in Sweden in recent years for its bulky shape and supposed lack of style. Often nicknamed the \\u201cmother sausage\\u201d, it\\u2019s commonly spotted on mothers with young babies out on stroller walks. While Swedish fashion journalist Samanda Ekman argues that the coat represents \\u201canti-fashion\\u201d, author Johanna Schreiber sees it as a symbol of \\u201cwomen\\u2019s liberation\\u201d. The coat\\u2019s popularity is easy to understand: filled with down, it\\u2019s loved for its cocoon-like warmth. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like wearing a duvet,\\u201d says Nina Lindesv\\u00e4rd, an engineer in Stockholm, who wears a black long puffer from Sams\\u00f8e Sams\\u00f8e. \\u201cIt\\u2019s also great for wearing with a skirt underneath \\u2013 or the opposite: sweatpants for a grocery run, and no one will notice. In general, I don\\u2019t like coats that don\\u2019t cover my behind.\\u201d While Lindesv\\u00e4rd\\u2019s jacket is only available for women, Rains does an excellent version for both women and men (my husband has one). Men\\u2019s $550 at Rains Women\\u2019s $550 at Rains Heated socks Unisex Non-compression version on Amazon, batteries included: $444.95 at Amazon Compression version on Amazon, batteries included: $479.94 at Amazon The most traditional Scandinavian sock is the hand-knitted wool sock, worn either on its own or layered over another sock inside shoes. Many families have someone who makes them, but if bought, they usually come from flea markets or directly from local makers. For Juho Pihlajaoja, a freelance stylist in Helsinki, it is a colourful version in blue, green and orange. \\u201cI\\u2019m sitting on a lounge chair post-sauna wearing a pair right now,\\u201d he says. As clothing has become more technical, however, many Scandinavians swear by knee-high socks heated with rechargeable batteries. \\u201cThey are incredible,\\u201d says Sophie Snell, a photographer based in the Swedish ski destination \\u00c5re, of her socks from Lenz. \\u201cIt\\u2019s something I truly can\\u2019t live without \\u2013 or work without, for that matter.\\u201d Lenz socks can be pricey, though Snell says: \\u201cI\\u2019ve had the same pair of socks for almost seven years now and they still haven\\u2019t broken.\\u201d These cheaper alternatives have decent reviews on Amazon \\u2013 though here at the Filter we don\\u2019t have personal experience of them. Amazon rechargeable electric heated socks $79.99 at Amazon Pedestrian safety reflector $14.99 at Amazon They may be tiny, but they make a huge impact during the dark Scandinavian winters. The pedestrian safety reflector, originally invented by Arvi Lehti in Pertteli, Finland, in 1963, is incredibly common. You\\u2019ll see them clipped to jackets and bags everywhere, especially since it gets dark so early in winter. According to the Finnish Road Safety Council, a person is normally visible in car headlights at 50 metres (165ft), but with a reflector, visibility increases to 350 metres (1,150ft). \\u201cIt\\u2019s a typical Finnish thing \\u2013 a little plastic piece you attach to your sleeve, in its most classic form, so you can be seen in the dark,\\u201d says Elna Nyk\\u00e4nen Andersson, a Finnish native now working as a diplomatic counsellor based in Tokyo. \\u201cThere are loads of different designs, but I wear the classic snowflake.\\u201d I haven\\u2019t been able to find this exact snowflake design on sale in the US, but based on my research this is a close contender.

The top priority for Norwegians is to dress according to the weather \\u2013 and there\\u2019s even a local word for the jacket: allv\\u00e6rsjakke, meaning \\u201call-weather jacket\\u201d.

(194, 74, 11, 'us-news/2025/nov/09/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-admin-prison-transfer', 'Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly ‘much happier’ after prison transfer by Trump officials', 'Jeffrey Epstein associate, serving 20 years for sex-trafficking crimes, is now in minimum-security federal prison in Texas', 'Longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes, has reportedly said that she is “much, much happier” after the Trump administration transferred her to a minimum-security federal prison in Texas, according to emails obtained by NBC News. Maxwell, 63, was moved from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the minimum-security Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Texas in August – just days after she was interviewed about the Epstein case by deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. Blanche is a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, who had been friends with the late Epstein – a convicted sex offender – before winning two presidencies. The interview with Blanche came as the administration faced growing pressure to release more documents related to the Epstein investigation, a pledge that Trump had made during his campaign. Maxwell’s transfer, which experts described as “unprecedented”, prompted questions as well as outrage from victims of Epstein, who died by suicide while incarcerated in 2019. They wondered why a convicted sex offender like Maxwell was moved to a facility where most of the inmates are serving time for non-violent offenses and white-collar crimes. And now, NBC News has obtained and revealed several emails that Maxwell reportedly sent to friends and relatives after her transfer that expressed delight at her new surroundings. The outlet says the emails were recently shared with the House Judiciary Committee. “My situation is improved by being at Bryan,” she wrote in one email. In another, she wrote: “The institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike.” Maxwell described the living conditions, stating that the kitchen “looks clean too – no possums falling from the celling to fry unfortunately on ovens, and become mingled with the food being served”. “I feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass,” Maxwell wrote in an email to a relative. “I am much much happier here and more importantly safe.” The food, she said, was “legions better” than where she was held previously. “The place is clean, the staff responsive and polite – I haven’t seen or heard the usual foul language or screaming accompanied by threats leveled at inmates by anyone,” she wrote. “I have not seen a single fight, drug deal, passed out person or naked inmate running around or several of them congregating in a shower!” NBC also reported that in other emails, Maxwell praised the prison camp warden as a “true professional” and also complained about “people selling rubbish stories and making money from their lies”. The emails were reportedly shared with the House judiciary committee after Maryland representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the committee, sent a letter to the warden of the Texas facility on 30 October. Raskin asked about reports that suggested Maxwell was receiving “VIP treatment” at the prison. He cited a Wall Street Journal article from October, where some current and former inmates said that Maxwell was getting “unusually favorable treatment at times”. In response to NBC’s reporting of Maxwell’s emails, one of her lawyers, David Oscar Markus, told the outlet: “There’s nothing journalistic about publishing a prisoner’s private emails, including ones with her lawyers. “That’s tabloid behavior, not responsible reporting. Anyone still interested in that kind of gossip reveals far more about themselves than about Ghislaine. It’s time to get over the fact that she is in a safer facility. We should want that for everyone.” Maxwell’s brother, Ian Maxwell, also told NBC in an email that messages between him and his sister are “personal and private by their very nature”. If those emails were sent to Congress and a reporter, he said, “then they were stolen and leaked without authorization and represent a breach of intellectual property rights and the fundamental right of all citizens to privacy.” The US supreme court in October declined to hear an appeal from Maxwell on her sex-trafficking conviction.', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-admin-prison-transfer', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/05a374b0faf9fbc85a4ee28c28cd4f577198adb2/326_0_2393_1916/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-admin-prison-transfer\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T18:07:18Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly \\u2018much happier\\u2019 after prison transfer by Trump officials\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-admin-prison-transfer\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/ghislaine-maxwell-trump-admin-prison-transfer\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly \\u2018much happier\\u2019 after prison transfer by Trump officials\",\"trailText\":\"Jeffrey Epstein associate, serving 20 years for sex-trafficking crimes, is now in minimum-security federal prison in Texas\",\"byline\":\"Anna Betts\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/05a374b0faf9fbc85a4ee28c28cd4f577198adb2\\/326_0_2393_1916\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes, has reportedly said that she is \\u201cmuch, much happier\\u201d after the Trump administration transferred her to a minimum-security federal prison in Texas, according to emails obtained by NBC News.

England will host the All Blacks after extending their winning run to nine matches with victory against Fiji, again romping clear in the final quarter, chalking up a 38-18 win. Their present form is in stark contrast to that of 12 months ago when England were mired in a run of six defeats in seven games, all by narrow margins. Three of those losses were inflicted by New Zealand – two on the 2024 summer tour before a 24‑22 defeat at Twickenham after George Ford missed two late kicks at goal. New Zealand edged out Scotland on Saturday to keep alive the All Blacks’ hopes of a home nations grand slam and, though the Springboks cemented their spot at the top of the rankings by beating France, George has heralded New Zealand as “arguably the best side in the world”. Of the past 11 meetings, England’s only win against New Zealand came in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and the All Blacks have not been beaten in the past five games at Twickenham. “What a lot of teams do is sit back in awe of the All Blacks with their history and all their incredible players,” George said. “It’s easy to do that. I’ve probably done it. We’ve also got to be aware we’ll be back here at Allianz Stadium. We’re very proud to be playing here. We are going to do everything we can to win that game. “You have to be at your best. New Zealand are arguably the best side in the world at the minute. They’re an unbelievably fantastic team and they seem to step up a gear when they come to Allianz Stadium. “The important thing for us to do is work out where we could have been better in the first half this week. But also have a clear gameplan which can put them under as much pressure as we possibly can. If we do that, we’ll give ourselves a chance. “We came under a bit of heat 12 months ago for not coming out on the right side of tight games and not finding a way to win. Now we’re doing the exact opposite. By no means have we cracked it. But we’ve placed a big emphasis on the latter stages of games and closing games out. Scoring however many tries in the last quarter of that game is a sign of a good team.” Borthwick is again expected to make a number of changes to his side with the captain, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Ford all expected to return to the starting lineup. Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi‑Waboso were both in the wars against Fiji but have been selected in the squad to face the All Blacks. “We want to challenge ourselves against the best teams and [New Zealand] are one of those best teams,” Borthwick said. “We’re a young side, we’re developing, I think we’re growing quickly and we’re keen to learn. So I’m sure next week’s going to be a great assessment for us.” Ben Earl, meanwhile, believes that England’s present ability to pull clear in the closing stages of matches owes much to their three narrow defeats by New Zealand last year. “You feel battle-hardened, you feel like you’ve got the wounds, you’ve got the scar tissue to learn from those losses, and they hurt at the time,” said Earl, who was named man of the match against Fiji. “But I wonder, to a man in the changing room, would we have changed our journey now, with the joy that we’re sometimes enjoying now? I’d be interested to know because I think they’re very, very valuable lessons.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/09/jamie-george-warns-england-not-to-sit-back-in-awe-at-new-zealands-aura', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/81fa8883878ecafabea080abf53b8b3bbb353b3f/424_0_4731_3786/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"sport\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/jamie-george-warns-england-not-to-sit-back-in-awe-at-new-zealands-aura\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"sport\",\"sectionName\":\"Sport\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T18:00:39Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Jamie George warns England not to sit back in awe at New Zealand\\u2019s aura\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/sport\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/jamie-george-warns-england-not-to-sit-back-in-awe-at-new-zealands-aura\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/sport\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/jamie-george-warns-england-not-to-sit-back-in-awe-at-new-zealands-aura\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Jamie George warns England not to sit back in awe at New Zealand\\u2019s aura\",\"trailText\":\"Jamie George said England must not be in awe of New Zealand\\u2019s reputation when they face them at Twickenham on Saturday\",\"byline\":\"Gerard Meagher\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/81fa8883878ecafabea080abf53b8b3bbb353b3f\\/424_0_4731_3786\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Jamie George has warned that England must not be seduced by the All Blacks\\u2019 mystique if they are to clinch a first Twickenham win against New Zealand in 13 years on Saturday.

Of the past 11 meetings, England\\u2019s only win against New Zealand came in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and the All Blacks have not been beaten in the past five games at Twickenham. \\u201cWhat a lot of teams do is sit back in awe of the All Blacks with their history and all their incredible players,\\u201d George said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to do that. I\\u2019ve probably done it. We\\u2019ve also got to be aware we\\u2019ll be back here at Allianz Stadium. We\\u2019re very proud to be playing here. We are going to do everything we can to win that game. \\u201cYou have to be at your best. New Zealand are arguably the best side in the world at the minute. They\\u2019re an unbelievably fantastic team and they seem to step up a gear when they come to Allianz Stadium. \\u201cThe important thing for us to do is work out where we could have been better in the first half this week. But also have a clear gameplan which can put them under as much pressure as we possibly can. If we do that, we\\u2019ll give ourselves a chance. \\u201cWe came under a bit of heat 12 months ago for not coming out on the right side of tight games and not finding a way to win. Now we\\u2019re doing the exact opposite. By no means have we cracked it. But we\\u2019ve placed a big emphasis on the latter stages of games and closing games out. Scoring however many tries in the last quarter of that game is a sign of a good team.\\u201d Borthwick is again expected to make a number of changes to his side with the captain, Maro Itoje, Tom Curry and Ford all expected to return to the starting lineup. Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi\\u2011Waboso were both in the wars against Fiji but have been selected in the squad to face the All Blacks. \\u201cWe want to challenge ourselves against the best teams and [New Zealand] are one of those best teams,\\u201d Borthwick said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re a young side, we\\u2019re developing, I think we\\u2019re growing quickly and we\\u2019re keen to learn. So I\\u2019m sure next week\\u2019s going to be a great assessment for us.\\u201d Ben Earl, meanwhile, believes that England\\u2019s present ability to pull clear in the closing stages of matches owes much to their three narrow defeats by New Zealand last year. \\u201cYou feel battle-hardened, you feel like you\\u2019ve got the wounds, you\\u2019ve got the scar tissue to learn from those losses, and they hurt at the time,\\u201d said Earl, who was named man of the match against Fiji. \\u201cBut I wonder, to a man in the changing room, would we have changed our journey now, with the joy that we\\u2019re sometimes enjoying now? I\\u2019d be interested to know because I think they\\u2019re very, very valuable lessons.\\u201d\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/sport\",\"pillarName\":\"Sport\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL),

Those most vulnerable to sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unsurprisingly, those who have less power or are treated with less respect: undocumented migrants; women in precarious employment; women with disabilities; LGBTQ women; young women and girls. Paradoxically, that helps to explain why the assault of Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, has drawn such outrage domestically and internationally. A drunken man tried to kiss her neck and grabbed her chest as she spoke to citizens in the capital’s streets. It is the proof, captured on camera, that no woman is safe. You can be the most powerful person in the land and a man will still feel entitled to grope you, in front of the world, because you are a woman. When you object, some will complain that you are taking it too seriously, or that it is all made up. As Ms Sheinbaum herself remarked: “If they do this to the president, then what will happen to all the young women in our country?” One in five girls and women in Mexico said they had experienced sexual violence in the community (as distinct from home, schools and workplaces) in the previous year, according to official figures from 2021. Ten women are killed each day. Ms Sheinbaum, like others, has noted the country’s machista reputation previously. But the problem does not end there. In the US and the UK, surveys suggest four out of five women (and two out of five men) have experienced sexual harassment and assault. When those at the top are targeted, it sends a message to all women, and often deliberately so. Whatever their accomplishments – Ms Sheinbaum is also an environmental scientist who contributed to the reports of the Nobel peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – they can be reduced to their bodies. Julia Gillard, Australia’s only female prime minister, was described as “deliberately barren”. Kamala Harris has long faced explicitly sexual rhetorical attacks. When the then prime minister Theresa May met Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, the front page of the Daily Mail asked of the two national leaders: “Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!” Politicians in general face an increasingly angry and violent political culture – in Mexico, many are killed each year – but women also face growing and more open sexism. The Reykjavik Index for Leadership, which measures perceptions in the G7 and Iceland, found last year that in the US, less than half of respondents felt “very comfortable” with the idea of a female political leader. Ms Sheinbaum is to be commended for pressing for charges and has rightly called for sexual harassment to be criminalised nationwide; many Mexican states have yet to do so. Yet, as mayor of Mexico City, when police cracked down on feminists demonstrating against gender-based violence, she referred to the protests as “provocations”. Women’s services have faced cuts under her administration. That does not lessen the importance of her stand this week. But it demonstrates that female leadership does not inevitably benefit women at the bottom, whatever they have in common with those at the top. Expanded social security programmes, initiated under Ms Sheinbaum’s predecessor, are already benefiting single mothers and others. But the president should seize this opportunity to embrace Mexico’s energetic grassroots feminist movement wholeheartedly, and work with it to tackle violence and misogyny, in the interests of all women.

Those most vulnerable to sexual harassment, assault and abuse are, unsurprisingly, those who have less power or are treated with less respect: undocumented migrants; women in precarious employment; women with disabilities; LGBTQ women; young women and girls. Paradoxically, that helps to explain why the assault of Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico\\u2019s president, has drawn such outrage domestically and internationally. A drunken man tried to kiss her neck and grabbed her chest as she spoke to citizens in the capital\\u2019s streets. It is the proof, captured on camera, that no woman is safe. You can be the most powerful person in the land and a man will still feel entitled to grope you, in front of the world, because you are a woman. When you object, some will complain that you are taking it too seriously, or that it is all made up. As Ms Sheinbaum herself remarked: \\u201cIf they do this to the president, then what will happen to all the young women in our country?\\u201d One in five girls and women in Mexico said they had experienced sexual violence in the community (as distinct from home, schools and workplaces) in the previous year, according to official figures from 2021. Ten women are killed each day. Ms Sheinbaum, like others, has noted the country\\u2019s machista reputation previously. But the problem does not end there. In the US and the UK, surveys suggest four out of five women (and two out of five men) have experienced sexual harassment and assault. When those at the top are targeted, it sends a message to all women, and often deliberately so. Whatever their accomplishments \\u2013 Ms Sheinbaum is also an environmental scientist who contributed to the reports of the Nobel peace prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\u2013 they can be reduced to their bodies. Julia Gillard, Australia\\u2019s only female prime minister, was described as \\u201cdeliberately barren\\u201d. Kamala Harris has long faced explicitly sexual rhetorical attacks. When the then prime minister Theresa May met Nicola Sturgeon in 2017, the front page of the Daily Mail asked of the two national leaders: \\u201cNever mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!\\u201d Politicians in general face an increasingly angry and violent political culture \\u2013 in Mexico, many are killed each year \\u2013 but women also face growing and more open sexism. The Reykjavik Index for Leadership, which measures perceptions in the G7 and Iceland, found last year that in the US, less than half of respondents felt \\u201cvery comfortable\\u201d with the idea of a female political leader. Ms Sheinbaum is to be commended for pressing for charges and has rightly called for sexual harassment to be criminalised nationwide; many Mexican states have yet to do so. Yet, as mayor of Mexico City, when police cracked down on feminists demonstrating against gender-based violence, she referred to the protests as \\u201cprovocations\\u201d.

Having arrived in London and recognised the grim everyday realities of inequality and discrimination that faced black people, she dedicated the rest of her life to doing something about it. She spent nearly half a century in south London working to improve the housing, education, health services and lifestyle of her community and then, on official “retirement”, went to the House of Lords in 1999. Tthe next 20 years she spent expounding her demands for equality to a wider audience, at Westminster and on international platforms in China, the Middle East and the US, seeking still to transform society and open the doors for others. She was not interested in rhetoric without reality, even less in tokenism. “Representation means little if the door behind you is closed to others,” she said. Howells was tireless, forceful, loved and also feared. She could not say “no” to anyone who wanted help and would not accept “no” as an answer from the forces of authority. She wanted equality and justice for everyone, in the streets and in the courts, for the 13 young black people killed in the New Cross fire in 1981 and for Stephen Lawrence, murdered in 1993. It was she who became a spokeswoman for the Lawrence family, who rattled on the doors of government for response and reaction. Her first job was in a public library, in Catford, south London, and she went back to college to train as a social worker. She worked for the London borough of Lewisham, helping young, single black mothers and then, in nearby Greenwich, she began confronting council policies across the range of social services. Most of her life was spent in community halls, classrooms, sports venues and committees, and her work was first recognised with appointment as OBE in 1994. She became the director of equal opportunities for the Greenwich Council for Racial Equality (1980-87) and she chaired the Lewisham Racial Equality Council (1994-97). Ros was born in St David, a parish in the south-east of Grenada, the daughter of Daphne George. She came to regard Joseph Gibbs, a primary school head teacher who was active in municipal politics, as her father. He was a one-time minister for communications and known universally as “Uncle Joe” and in the family as “Papa Joe”. The family was staunchly Roman Catholic and Gibbs was appointed a papal knight. Ros was educated at St Joseph’s convent from 1942 until 1949 and assisted in the school before taking a passage to the UK, accompanying a niece. The two girls hoped to emulate Ros’s adopted sister, Hilda Gibbs (later Dame Hilda Bynoe), who had graduated as a doctor in London that year – and who would later, in 1968, become governor of Grenada, the first Grenadian in that post and the first female governor in the British Commonwealth. Howells would be made a Companion of the Order of Grenada in 2009. Growing up in Grenada, Howells had known from childhood that education was the first goal. “Education is freedom and power,” she said once. “Any investment in education is a good one.” She was a governor of Avery Hill College for teacher training, which became part of Thames Polytechnic, and then the University of Greenwich (1985-97), and became the first female member of the court of governors of the university. She was appointed chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire (2009-14) and she was a board member of the Windward Islands research and education foundation, the research institute for St George’s University in Grenada. She was a trustee of St George’s UK Trust, of the Jason Roberts Foundation for sporting opportunities in the UK and Grenada, and of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust. At one stage, during a troubled period in Grenadian politics in the early 1980s, she served as Grenada’s deputy high commissioner in London. Howells was the first black female member of the former Greater London Training Board, established by the Greater London council to develop learning programmes. She was a lifelong member of the Labour party and active across a range of organisations, including the former West Indian Standing Conference, an umbrella organisation formed in response to the 1958 Notting Hill riots and operational until 2000. She also worked with the Women of the Year committee and was a patron of Greenwich and Bexley hospice (2014-2016). In the Lords she was a member of the constitution committee (2001-04), the works of art committee (2009-14) and the social mobility committee (2015-16). She retired from the Lords in 2019. In 1955 she married John Howells, a librarian she met when working at Catford Library. They had two daughters, Anne and Amanda. John died in 2004 and Amanda in 2011.

Half of all privately owned rural land is held by 421 people or entities. The roots of such disparities lie in the past. The 18th- and 19th-century Highland clearances emptied the glens and readied them for private takeover. On the continent, and eventually in England, the great estates were broken up by inheritance and land taxes. By comparison, Scotland is still feudal in scale. The passing of a land reform bill, its supporters say, will change that. But doubts remain. Its proponents say the legislation could allow the Scottish government to intervene in private land sales and require large estates to be broken up. At its heart is the so-called transfer test. This would see Scottish ministers notified before any land sale over 1,000 hectares. However, they lack an explicit veto. If they wanted a more democratic constraint, they could have adopted the Scottish Land Commission’s 2019 proposal for a public interest test – forcing big buyers to openly justify their purchases. Scottish ministers point out that by getting landowners to tell the government before any large-scale sale, they can give community groups a chance to put together a rival bid. But many big estates lie in sparsely populated upland areas where communities lack purchasing power. In theory, new “lotting” rules in the bill could diversify ownership by potentially splitting large sales into smaller plots. Yet the land reform expert Andy Wightman argues that such powers will rarely be used – and even then, existing landowners can simply buy the lots back. Mr Wightman, a former Green MSP, argues persuasively that the pattern of ownership results from a free market in land which privileges those with the deepest pockets. His reasoning is that Scotland’s land should be regulated as a shared resource in the public interest. Devolution has made this debate possible. Before 1999, Scottish land reform would have stalled in the Lords, where rich landlords literally sat in judgment. Despite more than a quarter of a century of argument, Scottish ministers are reluctant to adopt a more radical shake up. Craig Dalzell at the Common Weal thinktank suggests that a local land levy would make hoarding costly and fund community investment. The same council powers were used for Scotland’s tourist tax. Common Weal argues that Scotland should emulate Nordic nations, where smart taxes ensure smaller rural holdings. Significantly, they also encourage more sustainable patterns of forestry, farming and recreational use rather than absentee rents or speculation. Scottish land reform became a flashpoint in the 2014 independence campaign, because it raised questions of power and sovereignty that drove the wider debate. Yet it was the ruling Scottish National party that last month voted down attempts by opposition MSPs to place a cap on the amount of land that a single entity could own unless they could meet strict limits. No doubt SNP ministers feared scaring off investment, particularly in forest land brought for carbon offsetting, or being accused of confiscatory nationalism. The Scottish government’s reasoning – that ownership caps would be “a gift to those who want to maintain the status quo” – got it backwards. By refusing caps, Holyrood preserved the status quo itself. How tightly Scotland retains old structures of land and power depends on whether its democracy has the courage to break the bond.

(202, 2, 3, 'education/2025/nov/09/englands-curriculum-review-needs-to-be-more-radical', 'England’s curriculum review needs to be more radical', 'Letters: <strong>Dr Rupert Higham</strong>, <strong>Caroline Norbury </strong>and <strong>Colin Richards </strong>on recommendations in the Francis report', 'It’s hard to disagree with any of the sensible proposals in the Francis review (England curriculum should focus less on exams and more on life skills, finds review, 4 November). My concern is with their modesty in such extreme times. Research has revealed that 80% of headteachers in England think their role has a negative impact on their quality of life, with many making plans to retire or leave the profession early. And 75% of 16- to 25-year-olds describe the future as “frightening”, with justified anxiety about climate breakdown prevalent. So why focus on trimming the sails rather than turning the wheel? The suggestion of 10% less GCSE exam time and slightly reduced content is welcome. But as education is now compulsory until 18, why do we need GCSEs at all? Our teens spend more time preparing for exams than engaging in depth with the topics they cover, with a relentless prioritisation of targeted performance over broad intellectual, social and emotional development. A little more time on PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education) and sports is great, but not a solution. Teaching more about climate change without giving young people the skills and opportunities to take thoughtful, substantive action is likely to backfire, making them feel both responsible and powerless. The review we truly need would start by breaking a taboo: acknowledging that schooling’s current structure aims to give individuals the chance to demonstrate their superior worth to others and be rewarded with limited higher-value positions in working life. Often euphemised as “social mobility”, it lies in tatters as parental income continues to shape children’s economic success. As the world continues to catch fire, that new review would set out new pragmatic and humane principles for our critical times – that cooperation, more than competition, will secure young people’s futures, and that knowledge without the capacity to bring about change is a fast-devaluing currency. Curriculums that enable these principles already exist – many academics and teachers restlessly await the chance to implement them. Dr Rupert Higham Associate professor, UCL Institute of Education • At last, the curriculum review has confirmed what creatives up and down the country have long campaigned for: the end of the English baccalaureate (Ebacc). The qualification had a woeful oversight at its heart – an absence of arts and vocational subjects. Creative subjects should never have been treated like an optional extra for our children’s education. They provide young people with communication skills, independence and adaptability, supporting employability across a range of sectors. This move begins to repair the damage done by years of narrowing focus. Yet that progress will only endure if it is matched by joined-up reform beyond the classroom. The important work of creative education doesn’t stop at 16, but proposed changes set out in the post-16 education and skills white paper raise important questions about this continuation. The new V-levels aim to simplify level 3 qualifications, but it is still unclear if creative subjects will be eligible for maintenance support. Unless we join these dots, creativity will be left at the school gate – and the pipeline cut short. Post-16 policy must build on what schools have just regained. A rounded, cohesive, creative education is one of the most powerful investments this country could make. That cannot stop at 16. Caroline Norbury Chief executive, Creative UK • Any rethink of the national curriculum, ambitious or otherwise, faces at least two intractable difficulties. One is captured in the observation “Curriculum is a 10-letter word; that’s the extent of agreement about curriculum”.

My concern is with their modesty in such extreme times. Research has revealed that 80% of headteachers in England think their role has a negative impact on their quality of life, with many making plans to retire or leave the profession early. And 75% of 16- to 25-year-olds describe the future as \\u201cfrightening\\u201d, with justified anxiety about climate breakdown prevalent. So why focus on trimming the sails rather than turning the wheel? The suggestion of 10% less GCSE exam time and slightly reduced content is welcome. But as education is now compulsory until 18, why do we need GCSEs at all? Our teens spend more time preparing for exams than engaging in depth with the topics they cover, with a relentless prioritisation of targeted performance over broad intellectual, social and emotional development. A little more time on PSHE (personal, social, health and economic education) and sports is great, but not a solution. Teaching more about climate change without giving young people the skills and opportunities to take thoughtful, substantive action is likely to backfire, making them feel both responsible and powerless. The review we truly need would start by breaking a taboo: acknowledging that schooling\\u2019s current structure aims to give individuals the chance to demonstrate their superior worth to others and be rewarded with limited higher-value positions in working life. Often euphemised as \\u201csocial mobility\\u201d, it lies in tatters as parental income continues to shape children\\u2019s economic success. As the world continues to catch fire, that new review would set out new pragmatic and humane principles for our critical times \\u2013 that cooperation, more than competition, will secure young people\\u2019s futures, and that knowledge without the capacity to bring about change is a fast-devaluing currency. Curriculums that enable these principles already exist \\u2013 many academics and teachers restlessly await the chance to implement them. Dr Rupert Higham Associate professor, UCL Institute of Education \\u2022 At last, the curriculum review has confirmed what creatives up and down the country have long campaigned for: the end of the English baccalaureate (Ebacc). The qualification had a woeful oversight at its heart \\u2013 an absence of arts and vocational subjects. Creative subjects should never have been treated like an optional extra for our children\\u2019s education. They provide young people with communication skills, independence and adaptability, supporting employability across a range of sectors. This move begins to repair the damage done by years of narrowing focus. Yet that progress will only endure if it is matched by joined-up reform beyond the classroom. The important work of creative education doesn\\u2019t stop at 16, but proposed changes set out in the post-16 education and skills white paper raise important questions about this continuation. The new V-levels aim to simplify level 3 qualifications, but it is still unclear if creative subjects will be eligible for maintenance support. Unless we join these dots, creativity will be left at the school gate \\u2013 and the pipeline cut short. Post-16 policy must build on what schools have just regained. A rounded, cohesive, creative education is one of the most powerful investments this country could make. That cannot stop at 16. Caroline Norbury Chief executive, Creative UK \\u2022 Any rethink of the national curriculum, ambitious or otherwise, faces at least two intractable difficulties. One is captured in the observation \\u201cCurriculum is a 10-letter word; that\\u2019s the extent of agreement about curriculum\\u201d. The other is \\u201cEveryone is in favour of reform; it\\u2019s change that isn\\u2019t liked and will be resisted\\u201d.

Standing near the poll site at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Neda Davarpanah – a screenwriter and actor based in Los Angeles – was inspired by Mamdani’s campaign for mayor so she flew out to New York in late October to canvass on the Upper East Side. Davarpanah had walked alongside the picket lines in Hollywood in 2023 as a newly minted Writers Guild of America member. Despite initial momentum, she felt the energy from the frontlines of the strikes had dissipated in the last year. That energy reignited when Mamdani entered the picture. “We felt so motivated and energized to help people in a city we don’t even live in because of the broader impact on the country,” she said. Many of the people interviewed are part of the 4,000 young members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles chapter who felt inspired by Mamdani’s campaign and its national implications. Looking ahead, they want to bring the hope and lessons from field organizing back to Los Angeles. New York and Los Angeles have very different geographies and spreads of power. In Los Angeles, city council members’ elections tend to have more weight compared to a mayoral race. And given the DSA-LA chapter has endorsed five candidates so far in the city council and local school board elections, there are plenty of volunteer efforts for these hopefuls to work on in the coming year. Leslie Chang, who serves as the East San Gabriel Valley coordinator for Democratic Socialists of America, flew out during the primaries to canvass for Mamdani. She volunteered to canvass in Chinatown, where she spoke the language, and the Red Hook public housing projects. “These were tough conversations,” Chang said, noting residents felt left out in the city’s development. “They would say: look at the condition of this place that I live in. We are still waiting for repairs from the hurricane. Why should I give a shit who is running for office if my life hasn’t gotten better?” During her volunteer field training, Chang met two New York City council members who were vouching for Mamdani’s mayoral campaign. They told Chang to give out their phone numbers to start conversations with constituents. “I thought that was really powerful, because in almost all of the canvases that I do here [in Los Angeles], there isn’t that level of engagement,” she said. After canvassing, there was even a social event for volunteers to get to know one another and discuss what strategies worked best. Paul Zappia, an animator and illustrator who also serves in DSA-LA leadership, first met the mayor-elect in 2023 at the DSA national conference in Chicago, where Mamdani served as a keynote speaker. He flew out in late October to canvass with friends in Bushwick. At the beginning of his shift, the field lead asked why each volunteer had come out. “I shared with everybody that I was here from Los Angeles because the victory of Zohran Mamdani is bigger than New York City,” said Zappia, who attributes his involvement in politics to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign. Even walking to lunch a few blocks away, he encountered another canvassing group. “It’s just a bunch of people who are there on their free time and want to spend a couple hours on their Saturday together with other people that also care about their fellow working class people. And it was just such a blast,” he said. The geography and public transportation layout of New York’s five boroughs makes it easier to canvas in groups. Zappia said he could feasibly knock on hundreds of doors in a one-block radius there. In Los Angeles, a street could be filled with mostly single-family homes. And with the abundance of Ring doorbell cameras, people can easily decline a visitor from the comfort of their couch. Clayton Ryles, 31, only canvassed for one afternoon in Manhattan’s Chinatown in late October and felt the contrast between Mamdani’s campaign and others. In September last year, Ryles canvassed for Kamala Harris with his fellow United Auto Worker labor organizers in Las Vegas. Knocks on doors yielded intrepid voters who were “upset and suspicious”. Despite many people being pro-union, they felt that their cost of living was too high under Joe Biden. “Nobody was excited about the election. Everybody was like this is being inflicted upon us. We have to decide one way or another. For Zohran, most of the people were enthusiastic about what could happen with his mayoral tenure,” Ryles said. Davarpanah agreed, pointing to the call and response levels of Mamdani’s speech when crowds could clearly repeat phrases such as “fast and free buses” and “universal childcare”. “You can name them. Harris 2024 was not successful in articulating a vision,” she said. “A policy vision that materially impacts your constituents is something every candidate should take to heart. This is what actually inspires people to get involved when they actually see what you’re going to deliver.” Across social media, users have been making posts about how California, and Los Angeles specifically, needs a Mamdani. For Zappia, that means bringing back hope after a tough year that started with the Altadena wildfires and has continued with ICE raids, cutbacks to Snap benefits, and rising inflation, among many other difficulties. “People are just really looking for a sort of sign that things can turn around. In order to actually affect the change that we want to see, we have to first believe that we can actually do it,” he said. “And what happened in New York City is proof that it can be done, it’s proof that organized people can beat organized money.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/new-york-zohran-mamdani-los-angeles', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/98d11e4d794a048c8f5112078db75d2db93a8875/418_0_4164_3333/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/new-york-zohran-mamdani-los-angeles\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"us-news\",\"sectionName\":\"US news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-09T17:00:37Z\",\"webTitle\":\"They flew to New York to help Mamdani \\u2013 now they want to bring the hope to LA\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/new-york-zohran-mamdani-los-angeles\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/us-news\\/2025\\/nov\\/09\\/new-york-zohran-mamdani-los-angeles\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"They flew to New York to help Mamdani \\u2013 now they want to bring the hope to LA\",\"trailText\":\"Activists in Los Angeles say the energy from the Hollywood strikes has been reignited by the success of the mayor-elect\",\"byline\":\"Helen Li in Los Angeles\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/98d11e4d794a048c8f5112078db75d2db93a8875\\/418_0_4164_3333\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"While the excitement for mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has radiated through New York, his win has also energized young activists across the country \\u2013 particularly some in Los Angeles, who flew to the east coast to canvass for Mamdani and now want to bring their experiences westward.

And given the DSA-LA chapter has endorsed five candidates so far in the city council and local school board elections, there are plenty of volunteer efforts for these hopefuls to work on in the coming year. Leslie Chang, who serves as the East San Gabriel Valley coordinator for Democratic Socialists of America, flew out during the primaries to canvass for Mamdani. She volunteered to canvass in Chinatown, where she spoke the language, and the Red Hook public housing projects. \\u201cThese were tough conversations,\\u201d Chang said, noting residents felt left out in the city\\u2019s development. \\u201cThey would say: look at the condition of this place that I live in. We are still waiting for repairs from the hurricane. Why should I give a shit who is running for office if my life hasn\\u2019t gotten better?\\u201d During her volunteer field training, Chang met two New York City council members who were vouching for Mamdani\\u2019s mayoral campaign. They told Chang to give out their phone numbers to start conversations with constituents. \\u201cI thought that was really powerful, because in almost all of the canvases that I do here [in Los Angeles], there isn\\u2019t that level of engagement,\\u201d she said. After canvassing, there was even a social event for volunteers to get to know one another and discuss what strategies worked best. Paul Zappia, an animator and illustrator who also serves in DSA-LA leadership, first met the mayor-elect in 2023 at the DSA national conference in Chicago, where Mamdani served as a keynote speaker. He flew out in late October to canvass with friends in Bushwick. At the beginning of his shift, the field lead asked why each volunteer had come out. \\u201cI shared with everybody that I was here from Los Angeles because the victory of Zohran Mamdani is bigger than New York City,\\u201d said Zappia, who attributes his involvement in politics to the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign. Even walking to lunch a few blocks away, he encountered another canvassing group. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just a bunch of people who are there on their free time and want to spend a couple hours on their Saturday together with other people that also care about their fellow working class people. And it was just such a blast,\\u201d he said. The geography and public transportation layout of New York\\u2019s five boroughs makes it easier to canvas in groups. Zappia said he could feasibly knock on hundreds of doors in a one-block radius there. In Los Angeles, a street could be filled with mostly single-family homes. And with the abundance of Ring doorbell cameras, people can easily decline a visitor from the comfort of their couch. Clayton Ryles, 31, only canvassed for one afternoon in Manhattan\\u2019s Chinatown in late October and felt the contrast between Mamdani\\u2019s campaign and others. In September last year, Ryles canvassed for Kamala Harris with his fellow United Auto Worker labor organizers in Las Vegas. Knocks on doors yielded intrepid voters who were \\u201cupset and suspicious\\u201d. Despite many people being pro-union, they felt that their cost of living was too high under Joe Biden. \\u201cNobody was excited about the election. Everybody was like this is being inflicted upon us. We have to decide one way or another. For Zohran, most of the people were enthusiastic about what could happen with his mayoral tenure,\\u201d Ryles said. Davarpanah agreed, pointing to the call and response levels of Mamdani\\u2019s speech when crowds could clearly repeat phrases such as \\u201cfast and free buses\\u201d and \\u201cuniversal childcare\\u201d. \\u201cYou can name them. Harris 2024 was not successful in articulating a vision,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA policy vision that materially impacts your constituents is something every candidate should take to heart. This is what actually inspires people to get involved when they actually see what you\\u2019re going to deliver.\\u201d Across social media, users have been making posts about how California, and Los Angeles specifically, needs a Mamdani. For Zappia, that means bringing back hope after a tough year that started with the Altadena wildfires and has continued with ICE raids, cutbacks to Snap benefits, and rising inflation, among many other difficulties. \\u201cPeople are just really looking for a sort of sign that things can turn around. In order to actually affect the change that we want to see, we have to first believe that we can actually do it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd what happened in New York City is proof that it can be done, it\\u2019s proof that organized people can beat organized money.\\u201d\"},\"isHosted\":false,\"pillarId\":\"pillar\\/news\",\"pillarName\":\"News\"}', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', '2025-11-10 08:16:38', NULL),

(210, 69, 12, 'sport/2025/nov/09/donald-trump-stadium-name-washington-commanders-nfl', 'Can Donald Trump really make an NFL team name its stadium after him?', 'The president reportedly wants the new home of the Washington Commanders to bear his name. There are reasons to think he will succeed', 'Wait, Donald Trump is naming a stadium after himself? That’s if a well-sourced report from ESPN is to be believed. The US president has apparently let it be known to the ownership group of the Washington Commanders that he wants the team’s new stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2030, to take his name. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” a senior White House official told ESPN. Presumably Trump, as a serial winner, has chosen the Commanders because they’re the best team in the NFL? Not quite. While the franchise was a dominant force in the 1980s, its last Super Bowl appearance came in the 1991 season. Although the Commanders’ fortunes were revived last season thanks to new owners and a brilliant young quarterback in Jayden Daniels, their form has slumped again this season. So why would want Trump want to be associated with them? Good point – what would Trump have in common with a team with a dubious history with women and minorities? Having said that, the move would give Trump two things he enjoys: power and revenge. The NFL is by far the most popular league in America, as well as the richest in the world – having his name on one of its stadiums will make sure he is even more prominent than he already is. It would also be a counterpunch against a league with which Trump has had a fractious relationship. In 1983 he bought a franchise in the rival United States Football League in an attempt to force a merger with the NFL, only to wind up sinking the younger league. In 2014, Trump was frustrated in his attempt to enter the NFL’s inner circle when his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills fell short. The clashes have continued into his presidency: during his first term, he described NFL players protesting against social injustice as “sons of bitches”. In his second term he has urged the Commanders to revert to their previous racist nickname and attacked the league’s decision to choose Trump critic Bad Bunny to play the Super Bowl’s halftime show this season. Will he succeed? This is a man who has already managed to summon up various Trump Towers, Trump Plaza, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump Shuttle, Trump Vodka, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Mortgage and the Donald J Trump Ballroom (to name but a few). Plus, Trump has become adept at getting billionaires to do what he wants of late, while he has found himself given a warmer greeting in the sports world in his second term as president. The route to naming the stadium is a little tricky but Trump has leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the proposed site of the team’s new stadium, so he could speed up, or slow down, the process if he chose to. “He has cards to play,” one source told ESPN. “He can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.” It should also be noted that the Commanders will not be the ones to name the stadium. The proposed site sits on National Park Service land, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team. Again, Trump can lean on these bodies if he so chooses. “The team doesn’t have the authority. They can’t name the stadium on their own,” a source with direct knowledge of the process told ESPN. “The city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.” Are other NFL stadiums named after people? They are, but those people tend to be dead. Two of the most famous stadiums in the NFL – Green Bay’s Lambeau Field and Chicago’s Soldier Field – are tributes to people who have passed away. In Green Bay’s case, the stadium was renamed for the team’s founder and coach Earl “Curly“ Lambeau a few months after his death, while the stadium in Chicago was a tribute to US soldiers who had died in the first world war. Washington’s former stadium was named after a politician, but its name illustrates how it differed from Trump’s proposal: the Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium was renamed as a tribute to the US senator who was assassinated several months beforehand. It’s also notable that Lambeau and RFK did not lobby to get their names on the stadiums. So which stadiums are named after living world leaders? It should be noted that Trump would – probably – be out of power by the time the new Commanders stadium opens. But you can draw your own conclusions from living leaders who have their names on stadiums.

That\\u2019s if a well-sourced report from ESPN is to be believed. The US president has apparently let it be known to the ownership group of the Washington Commanders that he wants the team\\u2019s new stadium, which is scheduled to open in 2030, to take his name. \\u201cIt\\u2019s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,\\u201d a senior White House official told ESPN. Presumably Trump, as a serial winner, has chosen the Commanders because they\\u2019re the best team in the NFL? Not quite. While the franchise was a dominant force in the 1980s, its last Super Bowl appearance came in the 1991 season. Although the Commanders\\u2019 fortunes were revived last season thanks to new owners and a brilliant young quarterback in Jayden Daniels, their form has slumped again this season. So why would want Trump want to be associated with them? Good point \\u2013 what would Trump have in common with a team with a dubious history with women and minorities? Having said that, the move would give Trump two things he enjoys: power and revenge. The NFL is by far the most popular league in America, as well as the richest in the world \\u2013 having his name on one of its stadiums will make sure he is even more prominent than he already is. It would also be a counterpunch against a league with which Trump has had a fractious relationship. In 1983 he bought a franchise in the rival United States Football League in an attempt to force a merger with the NFL, only to wind up sinking the younger league. In 2014, Trump was frustrated in his attempt to enter the NFL\\u2019s inner circle when his bid to buy the Buffalo Bills fell short. The clashes have continued into his presidency: during his first term, he described NFL players protesting against social injustice as \\u201csons of bitches\\u201d. In his second term he has urged the Commanders to revert to their previous racist nickname and attacked the league\\u2019s decision to choose Trump critic Bad Bunny to play the Super Bowl\\u2019s halftime show this season. Will he succeed? This is a man who has already managed to summon up various Trump Towers, Trump Plaza, Trump Steaks, Trump University, Trump Shuttle, Trump Vodka, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Mortgage and the Donald J Trump Ballroom (to name but a few). Plus, Trump has become adept at getting billionaires to do what he wants of late, while he has found himself given a warmer greeting in the sports world in his second term as president. The route to naming the stadium is a little tricky but Trump has leverage. As president, he oversees the federal agencies responsible for environmental and land-use approvals at the proposed site of the team\\u2019s new stadium, so he could speed up, or slow down, the process if he chose to. \\u201cHe has cards to play,\\u201d one source told ESPN. \\u201cHe can make it very difficult to get this stadium built unless people align with him on the name.\\u201d It should also be noted that the Commanders will not be the ones to name the stadium. The proposed site sits on National Park Service land, and the District of Columbia Council will lease the stadium to the team. Again, Trump can lean on these bodies if he so chooses. \\u201cThe team doesn\\u2019t have the authority. They can\\u2019t name the stadium on their own,\\u201d a source with direct knowledge of the process told ESPN. \\u201cThe city would be involved, and the Park Service would be involved.\\u201d Are other NFL stadiums named after people?

After consuming one of the government’s free school meals this October, 16-year-old Nabila and 500 other students at schools in her area became violently ill. “I’ve seen nothing like it, even during Covid-19,” said Aep Kunaepi, who works at the shelter Nabila was taken to before she was admitted to hospital for three days. The Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto, in January unveiled his flagship free meals programme to combat malnutrition and stunted growth. But thousands have been poisoned by the government-provided food since, sparking concern the programme is putting child safety at risk. The £3.2bn free meal programme provides daily meals to 39 million school students, toddlers, pregnant women and new mothers, according to the national nutrition agency, known as BGN. By year end the target is to reach 83 million. But experts say the government needs to get it right before scaling up the programme, with Prabowo’s signature policy marred by consecutive food poisoning outbreaks. On social media, complaints have flooded in about maggots in tempeh, shards of glass in rice, and food trays washed in dirty water, while mothers’ groups have organised mass protests. ‘We admit we are not perfect’ The Indonesian Education Monitoring Network, an NGO, has documented more than 15,000 cases of poisoning linked to the programme nationwide, and the outbreaks do not appear to be slowing. This September, more than 1,300 children fell ill in Cipongkor, West Java, with other outbreaks in Yogyakarta, Central Java and Sumatra. Jakarta-based nutritionist Dr Tan Shot Yen, representing an advocacy group called the Mother and Child Health Movement, said the government’s focus on scale had put children’s lives at risk. “This programme’s implementation has been careless,” she said. “Bacterial contamination like salmonella or E coli could become endemic if unchecked.” Prabowo has played down the scale of the problem, saying that of more than a billion meals served, poisoning cases represented just “0.0017% – quite a proud achievement”. He also said the policy had improved school attendance and achievement. Facing mounting anger, Prabowo last week drafted a decree on new regulations to improve food safety. BGN head Dadan Hindayana said the government’s goal was to reach “zero incidents” through stricter hygiene and smaller kitchen operations. The agency plans to expand to 32,000 kitchens by next year, with a budget equivalent to £15.2bn by 2026. BGN spokeswoman Dian Fatwa said investigations into food poisoning incidents found improper food storage, poor sanitation and late delivery of cooked meals were often to blame. The agency temporarily suspended 132 kitchens, with 27 retrained and cleared to reopen. “We admit we are not perfect,” she said. “But we are improving constantly.” Fatwa said their official count of food poisoning incidents was much lower than those reported by NGOs. By the end of September, the agency had confirmed 6,517 cases. Experts, however, say the new safeguards come too late. Diah Saminarsih, founder of the Centre for Indonesia’s Strategic Development Initiatives, accused the “gigantic” programme of being dangerously rushed. “In West Java one kitchen may cater to 3,500 students,” she said. “There’s no way a nutritionist can control quality under those conditions. “A project costing [£15.2bn] cannot operate without a strong regulatory framework,” she added. “Who is accountable when children get poisoned?” Indonesian political researcher Made Supriatma, a visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said the programme was meant as a “quick win” for Prabowo’s first 100 days in office but had backfired. “It has turned into a huge problem for Prabowo,” he said. “It is getting bad attention – people are angry right now.” Supriatma said there were also concerns about the police and military running some kitchens, which he said reflected a “reversion to authoritarianism” and deepening patronage politics. The presidential palace did not respond to questions about these claims, but the government has previously denied accusations of an authoritarian turn. “This has one of the biggest budgets in history, yet there is not one single regulation which ensures it will be managed in a transparent and accountable way,” said Egi Primayogha of Indonesia Corruption Watch. During a government-arranged media visit to a kitchen and school in South Jakarta, the Guardian observed the delivery of hundreds of meals of rice, chicken and vegetables, prepared by staff in crisp white uniforms. Saidah, principal of Cipedak primary school, said the programme had made a real difference for many families struggling with rising food prices. At a later delivery, one breastfeeding mother, Rohmani, said she felt reassured knowing she could provide adequate nutrition to her baby. Five of her other children also received the meals. But not everyone is convinced. Nabila’s mother welcomed the free lunches at first but says after her daughter’s experience she is no longer an advocate. “We’re talking about children’s lives,” she said, “I don’t want other parents and their children to have to go through anything like this.”', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/10/maggots-in-the-tempeh-glass-in-the-rice-indonesias-free-school-meals-tainted-by-food-poisoning', 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cfe6d2ed9015bd70fa6a9a8b4c88dcac99f8fd81/562_0_5600_4480/500.jpg', NULL, '{\"id\":\"world\\/2025\\/nov\\/10\\/maggots-in-the-tempeh-glass-in-the-rice-indonesias-free-school-meals-tainted-by-food-poisoning\",\"type\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"world\",\"sectionName\":\"World news\",\"webPublicationDate\":\"2025-11-10T00:30:46Z\",\"webTitle\":\"Maggots in the meals, glass in the rice: Indonesia\\u2019s free school meals tainted by food poisoning\",\"webUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.theguardian.com\\/world\\/2025\\/nov\\/10\\/maggots-in-the-tempeh-glass-in-the-rice-indonesias-free-school-meals-tainted-by-food-poisoning\",\"apiUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/content.guardianapis.com\\/world\\/2025\\/nov\\/10\\/maggots-in-the-tempeh-glass-in-the-rice-indonesias-free-school-meals-tainted-by-food-poisoning\",\"fields\":{\"headline\":\"Maggots in the meals, glass in the rice: Indonesia\\u2019s free school meals tainted by food poisoning\",\"trailText\":\"Thousands of cases of food poisoning have been linked to programme launched with fanfare by the president, Prabowo Subianto\",\"byline\":\"Michael Neilson in Cisarua\",\"thumbnail\":\"https:\\/\\/media.guim.co.uk\\/cfe6d2ed9015bd70fa6a9a8b4c88dcac99f8fd81\\/562_0_5600_4480\\/500.jpg\",\"bodyText\":\"Rini Irawati feared the worst when she found her teenage daughter Nabila pale and barely breathing in an emergency centre in Indonesia\\u2019s West Java. \\u201cMy heart was shattered,\\u201d Rini said.
